I will have my harp do the talking.",

Give me your hand, I'll teach you.",

Also, may I trouble you to look over my proposal on the mobile plate transfer once again... I'm scary when I smile, you say? Then do your best to get all this sorted quickly, alright?",
        "char_4193_lemuen_CN_003": "Yes, this <i>is</i> your office. I took the liberty of revamping it and adding a few confetti guns and a scripture disco-ball here and there. You say El caused an explosion here, while trying to cook some popcorn with her gun...? Yes, I knew that, but as they say back in Laterano, 'an explosion unseen is an explosion clean'.",
        "char_4193_lemuen_CN_004": "My signature? Ah, I did contribute a little to 'Botanical Review', yes. It wasn't anything I had to do for work. Rather, I simply had too many types of flowers around my sickbed. One time, Mostima was in such a rush, all she could offer me was a potato that had started to bloom. With that many flowers on hand, how could I not learn a thing or two about them?",
        "char_4193_lemuen_CN_005": "This scrape on my hand? Just from getting a little physical. During fieldwork, you sometimes run into the types who simply have no respect for the ill. Fiammetta was just about boiling over, so I saw fit to educate them in a... fitting manner. I may not mind, personally, but that doesn't mean I have to force my friends to ignore it.",

Checking on new arrivals to see how they're settling in, seeing if people are doing alright at the monasteries... After all, without them, what would even be left of Laterano today?",

        "char_4193_lemuen_CN_009": "Are you always so quick to notice when someone is watching you? Oh, forgive me, it's a habit of mine to observe others.

Then, would you like to receive this medal from the Seventh Tribunal for outstanding cooperation, to put <i>me</i> at ease? You can have two, if you'd like. You could even pin them on your eyemask, one for each eye.",

I understand you spent several years asleep due to some unfortunate accident as well, correct? I know you might not mind, but the time we lose is never only lost by ourselves. Come, there's still plenty of time today to hold a few parties.",

We have a similar speech at our annual meetings at the Seventh Tribunal, but it's a lot shorter than the celebratory gunfire segment... Hmm? I'm just getting a piece of candy. I know you're not simply going through the motions when you speak, so I'll be listening to the very end.",

We never quite saw eye-to-eye from a young age, though we managed to work together for decades because we shared the same devotion to the Holy City. Even today, I wouldn't say we're much more than acquaintances... but then, perhaps the fact that we're not friends is precisely the reason we've been able to tolerate each other for so long.",

It was only a long time later I realized it wasn't because of me that they left, but because of Laterano. The city's glory is like the sun, its brilliant radiance suffers no stars. But it is the duty of the stars to shine upon the night where the sun does not.",

I guess it's my fault for making fun of her too much when she was little. But then, where's the fun in raising a child, if you don't make fun of her?",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_008": "What a tear-jerker. I should've picked a comedy for movie night. How embarrassing, crying my heart out like that in front of you... the tear glands get so much weaker as you age, you know. Say, am I imagining it, or are your eyes even redder than mine are? Come now, no need to fight the tears.",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_009": "This letter? Oh, it's nothing, just word that an old friend has passed away. I personally escorted her out of the Holy City when she contracted Oripathy, many years ago. I don't even remember what she looked like, how awful I am. I wish I could've seen her one last time, even if it meant getting punched in the face.",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_010": "Feel free to lean against me if you're tired, though I'm not exactly soft. This suit is almost as ancient as I am. It's gone through quite a few major overhauls, but it's still a... reliable partner.",

        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_013": "What is WRONG with your medics?! Do they think I'm a child? A medal just for cooperating with medical personnel? Shouldn't that be common sense? And… what're they giggling about?",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_014": "You see all these medals? That Vampire told me to come here to claim my prize. I can't guess what you're going to give me. Another medal? Is it a 'collect twenty to get the grand prize' deal?",

        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_030": "No need to thank me. I hardly broke a sweat.",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_031": "Are we done? We should go home, then. If we didn't do bad, then I say we did good.",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_032": "I'm fine. I've been in worse pickles before. Come now, don't look so sullen. Maybe a bit of ice cream will cheer you up? My treat.",

        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_042": "I brought some pastries. You can share them.",
        "char_4194_rmixer_CN_043": "I heard it's your birthday. So I brought a vintage from my cellar to join in the fun... Oh, no need to be so polite. A bottle doesn't compare to a good time spent with friends.",

        "char_426_billro_CN_009": "If it's at all possible, I'd rather stay out of the nobles' bickering. Do you know how much I have to worry about each and every day with all the chaperone work and missions on my plate? Maybe I should talk the count into letting me hop over here full time. I'm relying on you to keep me under your wing when the time comes, Doctor.",

Each time such an occasion arises, I reflect on what remains unaccomplished. The terminus of ideals and hatred lies far beyond sight, much like the unpredictable end of one's life.

        "char_472_pasngr_epoque#17_CN_013": "Oripathy has robbed me of my future. I hope that Rhodes Island can make use of what I have left. Wrong. Nobody in Rhodes Island can indulge your desire for self-harm. It is not that they are too kind, it is that you are too harsh. This is Elliot Glover's conclusion.",
        "char_472_pasngr_epoque#17_CN_014": "Will you see the Sargon's winter when you awake? Will you sleep away in the eternal summer? Must I become you? Prophecy is but fate in disguise.

        "char_472_pasngr_epoque#17_CN_042": "I dreamed of a future where all faded into nothingness with the changing seasons. No sweet dreams, no nightmares, only... darkness. That is where fate will lead us, Elliot. That darkness is no metaphor, just nothingness itself.",

I never saw their faces, nor did I care to. My face and chest felt cold, but my hands gripping my blade were warm. Tsk, why am I even telling you all this? Just forget what I said.",
        "char_475_akafyu_CN_007": "Um? How many times have I told you? Don't stand in front of me all of a sudden! What? You wanted me to see you better? You're a strange fellow. I don't need to look at you to know it's you. You think I would just let anybody come this close to me?",
        "char_475_akafyu_CN_008": "Dr.{@nickname}, you remind me of my master when you get serious. I suppose it's because… both you and her compel yourselves to go forward in chase of a grand, ambitious goal.",

        "char_475_akafyu_CN_042": "Yo, Doctor, how about some katana training together?",
        "char_475_akafyu_CN_043": "Oh? Today's your birthday, Dr.{@nickname}? Haha! Come, I'll take you for ale and meat! Honestly, why stay quiet about a day so important? Hm? You wonder what I would've gotten you if I knew? Well, need you ask? Better ale and even more meat!",

I wanted to go back to Siesta to make a living, only to find a pile of volcanic ash waiting for me. It took a lot of work to find the new Siesta, so I was real happy that day. I even yelled out loud: Hey hey hey—That's it for my rotten luck! Everything's going to work out just fine from here on out!"
