        "char_002_amiya_CN_002": "Dr. Kal'tsit told me you have to be 100% focused on your work to maximize efficiency. So... yes, that's what I'm gonna do!",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_003": "Rhodes Island has achieved cruising speed, Doctor. Would you mind sorting out the navigation log for me?",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_004": "I still have a lot to learn as leader of Rhodes Island. I hope you'll be there to guide me on our path to the future.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_005": "Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I hope Rhodes Island can be like a second home to everyone.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_006": "Making it this far has cost us so much. Sometimes, I can't help but ask myself... is it really worth it?",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_007": "Sometimes I remember where I came from... It was cold, and the air smelled of rusted copper. Rhodes Island is a cozy place in comparison. I'll do everything I can to protect our home.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_008": "Hehe… Dr. {@nickname}, let me tell you something: I picked up the violin again.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_009": "We've still got a long, long way to go, Doctor. This might be a journey without an end, but as long as you're with me, we'll be okay.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_010": "There's still lots of work that needs to be done, Doctor. We can't afford to have you resting.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_011": "I'm so glad you're back, Doctor. Now we can walk this path together, me with you, and you with me.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_012": "I see... thank you, Doctor! I've learned so much from you.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_013": "I'm so excited to fight by your side again, Doctor!",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_014": "What I saw that day... the despair stuck in my throat, hopelessly trying to scream... I want to bury it all deep inside my mind and never let it out…",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_017": "Got it.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_018": "I won't let you down.",

        "char_002_amiya_CN_028": "I hear... someone crying?",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_029": "No matter how difficult the mission, we can handle it as long as you're here, Doctor. I've never doubted you.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_030": "We may have achieved a perfect victory, but we still can't let our guard down.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_031": "Well done, Doctor! You must be exhausted. Be sure to rest when you need it.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_032": "I'm fine... Get it together, everyone!",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_033": "You want something to drink, Doctor?",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_034": "Huh? Doctor?",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_036": "Ehehe...",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_038": "Happy New Year, Doctor! Please make sure you get lots of rest today... Y-You've already worked for the better part of the day? Did I get here too late? Sorry...Blaze just asked me to get my height measured... Oh, you're just joking? Thank goodness.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_042": "Welcome home, Doctor!",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_043": "Doctor, if you can remember even some of your past... That would make me really happy. Right, I'm still not very good at the violin, but... since you're the only one here to listen, there's a song I'd like to practice. A sort of nostalgic song.",
        "char_002_amiya_CN_044": "I remember the names of those who've left us, and I can still feel the lingering fear, rage, and pain of battle. But if I'm to give a speech in front of everyone, I want to tell a story of hope instead. Doctor, I'm a little nervous... Could you hold my hand, please?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_001": "Doctor, please sit. I'm just here to give you a physical examination, so relax. If there are any irregularities, please tell me in full. Meaning? We'll set aside what it means to Rhodes Island for now. To me, the meaning it holds is quite significant.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_002": "I will conduct scientific examinations on you at regular intervals, recording your vital signs and state of consciousness. No other personnel have this authority. If anyone wishes to conduct an examination on you, you have the right to refuse. Do you understand?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_003": "Medical is the core Department of Rhodes Island. Theoretical research and practical treatment both require medical talent, and the need for medical staff on field missions is always growing. Please remember that in the time to come, you will need to recruit ever more Medic Operators.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_004": "I'm sure, on a daily basis, you interact with many Operators. When you converse with them, you must be alert for any speech that attempts to influence your will. Remember to preserve your ego; at necessary times, I suggest you seek my help. Of course, for you... I should be unnecessary, shouldn't I?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_005": "Amiya has left to eat with the young Operators. She is a child too, and you should accompany her as well. These lands have no mercy on the basis of age, but children will always be our unvarying hope. I very much admire this notion of... a certain someone's.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_006": "Doctor, do you ever doubt the meaning in your own existence? I do. Life upon these lands is tremendously tenacious. It evolves to suit a unique niche, often finding nurtured tameness and confrontation futile. What is our destination, Doctor? I believe you will find an answer. I can only persevere in that belief.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_007": "Don't spare too much worry for me. Rhodes Island shouldn't be so fragile that one person's departure would leave it unable to proceed on. What is it? No, it's only a slightly hyperbolic supposition. No matter what, I thank you for your concern, Doctor. But more than myself, I am concerned for you.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_008": "The path along which Amiya grew into Rhodes Island's leader was considerably troubled, and the sacrifices we've made bear testimony to that. From the faintest glimpse you caught in that stretch of the past, you may gradually come to understand the meaning of it all. You can make your own choices, Doctor... someone once told me that.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_009": "My hope? It is to protect yours and Amiya's hopes, Doctor. Though our definitions of 'protect' have nothing in common, it's an oath I will never abandon. I will be standing here with you, until the very end. We are unable to forget the past, but a different future may await you.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_010": "Are you awake, or still in a dream?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_011": "Doctor, my appearance here indicates that the situation has turned for the worse. You must <i>concentrate</i> on continuing to accomplish your mission.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_012": "Not bad.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_013": "With strength comes fragility. Such is the principle of all living things.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_014": "Mon3tr and I will protect everyone. Especially you, Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_017": "I will see to them.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_018": "Now you need only devote yourself to operation planning.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_019": "Let's go.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_020": "You know the plan. Move to intercept.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_021": "What's the situation?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_022": "Optimize your deployment.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_023": "Arrived at designated position.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_024": "Mon3tr, with me.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_025": "Mon3tr.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_026": "Perform your task.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_027": "Awake.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_028": "Go ahead.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_029": "Make sure a video record of this battle is properly cataloged.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_030": "Mon3tr, collect tissue samples.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_031": "Assess the risk coefficient of those fleeing, as well as the possibility of a reprisal attack by enemy forces.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_032": "Secure evac route. Prepare to operate!",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_033": "How is the infrastructure project here developing?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_034": "What are you doing?",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_036": "You seem to have grown used to your own work and responsibility. You've become much like a leader.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_038": "It is once again the New Year. I only hope that you will find a suitable manner with which you can enjoy this brief holiday logically. Additionally, I wish that you will enjoy this upcoming year in good health, and won't spend too much time in the infirmary.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_042": "Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_043": "So this is the day you've chosen, is it? I won't ask you about the significance of the date. You are free to keep the answer to yourself. I only hope that your choice will serve to give more meaning to Rhodes Island's existence. Of course, if you would like, I can offer you my well wishes, too. Happy birthday.",
        "char_003_kalts_CN_044": "It is not for anyone to tell you what the significance Rhodes Island carries is. Neither should you be bound by your unreachable memories. Instead, the current you must find that answer yourself. There will come a day when you'd decide Rhodes Island's course. I trust that your decision will bear responsibility to the ideals that we discussed.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_001": "The Ark does not have the resources to maintain unnecessary, extended communications. But there will be no restrictions on transmissions between the two of us. Keep the channel open.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_002": "With the Originium held back by the curtains Rhodes Island has drawn, mankind was able to build the Ark and drag out its feeble existence. Yet the pressures of survival cannot suppress greed and desire. Every faction's leader yearns to become the administrator who holds all the keys. I understand that you pity them for their predicament, but you must decide based on your own judgment.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_003": "Inactive Originium solidified and accumulated, while redundant information piled atop itself in layers, giving us a new home. Only because you were there by our side could we delay the awakening of the arrogant master of all creation. All those who survived rely on your aid. They are all very appreciative, and so am I.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_004": "The people of today may still remember what trees looked like. That is why they can point to Originium clusters and call them an Originium Forest. But when we can no longer conceive of trees and woods, the word 'forest' will forever disappear from our languages. If things continue that way, 'these lands' will cease to exist as well.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_005": "Originium soared through the skies and seized the twin moons, its clusters dispersing into the universe like spores, contacting and assimilating both the living and the dead— This is what is currently happening outside of Terra. Originium is swallowing everything into its body and incubating an all-encompassing chaos. But Terra can still be saved, and only because you remain by our side.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_006": "Under the curtain weaver, symptoms of Oripathy have faded into history, yet mankind continues to voice its dissatisfaction. The old order did collapse, but the minds of man remain narrow. Amiya must still go hither and thither to unite them. While she is now an excellent leader, you are still the only one she can rely on.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_007": "We can no longer draw meaningful lessons from past experiences. The answers to our questions come not from our collective pool of knowledge, but from innovation and imagination. As you are more proficient than I in those aspects, there is no need to seek my advice on every single matter. Your insights are more important than my opinion here.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_008": "You already know how 'death' functions for me. So there's no need to worry about the damage I take. Instead, you should pay more attention to your own condition. The sarcophagus cannot heal the trauma wrought by extreme stress and exhaustion. If there is anything you would like to say, I will listen.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_009": "I can hear the crystal clusters surging. The Originium tides will soon dissolve me... Don't give me that look. Take care of Amiya and the city. We can continue to work on those problems the next time we speak. Well, then... see you again, Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_010": "Scanning... The atmospheric oxygen level is still decreasing... No, let the Doctor rest. I will check it out.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_011": "The anti-Originium communication lines have been activated... Signal received. Come in, Babel. This is Kal'tsit, exploring the former Leithanien region as planned. No coagulation point found as of yet. What about you, Doctor? What's the situation there?",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_012": "Experiences from before the crystallization age are for reference only. Do not overly rely on them.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_013": "Formalities are no longer necessary between you and I. You need only keep your promise to maintain the Ark's safe course.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_014": "Mon3tr, these tattered lands will one day need you more than ever. Now, with your own voice, say hello to the Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_017": "I will correct any flawed decisions that occur during exploration.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_018": "Mark the area you need explored. I will arrange for the rest.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_019": "All units, double check the status of your anti-Originium equipment.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_020": "Stick to the plan. Do not throw your life away for nothing.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_021": "What's your plan?",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_022": "I will synchronize the battlefield data.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_023": "Executing battle plan.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_024": "Mon3tr.",

        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_026": "Suppressing Originium activity.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_027": "Follow my orders, Mon3tr.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_028": "On my mark, prepare to counterattack.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_029": "How much time do we have left?  I see… I trust your judgment.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_030": "All units, proceed according to plan. I will hand the report to the Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_031": "You should be more careful. We can't afford even a single loss.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_032": "All personnel, retreat to safe zone. Comm permits are transferred to you for now. I will sort out the situation before us.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_033": "The facilities are fairly well-maintained.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_034": "Seems you are still very fond of your little tricks.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_036": "Have you ever imagined a future where only you remain?",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_038": "Holidays may not provide much joy to anyone anymore, but there is not much left to commemorate. Do not let Originium take away these precious memories too. These are the best wishes I can offer you.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_042": "There is still much we can do, Doctor.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_043": "I will return to the Ark tonight. I hope to see you through the anti-Originium curtain, just like in years past.",
        "char_003_kalts_boc#6_CN_044": "The lights of Rhodes Island once illuminated the night sky, and everyone aboard celebrated throughout the night, both on the bridge and in their cabins. Those were the good old days, yet now our operators can only shut off their electricity and drift to sleep even a moment sooner. All the effort we put in today is to allow civilization to shed light upon the lands anew.",
        "char_009_12fce_CN_001": "Forgive me, Doctor... There are limits to what I can do, including in conversation... but I'm honored to be your assistant. I look forward to helping you with your work.",
        "char_009_12fce_CN_002": "Doctor, time heals all wounds. Please have more confidence in yourself. Your Operators have chosen to follow you because we believe that you will bring positive change.",
        "char_009_12fce_CN_003": "Many Infected have relocated to Rhodes Island... not because they have any particular goals to achieve, but simply because they want a place to call home. The world outside no longer accepts them, after all...",

        "char_009_12fce_CN_009": "She has finally found you, Doctor. What a perilous journey it's been. You're very important to her, as well as to everyone else.",
        "char_009_12fce_CN_010": "I'll be by your side watching over you, Doctor, even in your sleep. So rest easy, you have nothing to fear.",
        "char_009_12fce_CN_011": "You have my thanks for allowing me to join you. From now on, I will do my best to serve you, Doctor, with my alchemical skills. I have never had a name... but if you must call me something, you can refer to me as 12F.",

But when the wind rises and waves swell, sleep won't come so easily. So I've brought you this bucket, use it if seasickness strikes. Just be sure to aim well; our cleaning crew won't take kindly to a messy deck.",

They voted to hang me from the mast the entire night.",

        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_009": "Oh, Doctor. How did you find this sanctuary? Me...? When the crew gets too rowdy, I retreat here for some peace and quiet. Isn't it strange? Out here, where the only sound is the wind and the waves, I somehow hear the echoes of voices from Rhodes Island.",
        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_010": "Asleep already? I never expected you to adapt to the rocking waves so quickly... Though, I've heard that people find rest where they feel secure.",

        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_014": "Congratulations, Doctor. In recognition of your exceptional service aboard, and the profound bond you've forged with the First Mate's pet, the crew and I have voted unanimously to promote you to the distinguished rank of Senior Groomer.",
        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_017": "Doctor, take the helm for now. This will be a tough battle, and my crew needs me to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with them.",

        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_030": "What we just encountered is but a minor hiccup before lengthy voyage. Cheer up, Doctor. Far greater trials await us ahead.",

When the revelry begins, keep clear of the railings. We can't risk a tipsy Doctor going overboard. Ah, why am I even concerned...? Ahem, just, uh, trust me on this one.",
        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_042": "Hello, Doctor. We are sailing towards the rising sun.",
        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_043": "Today's your birthday, Doctor? After drifting on the seas for so long, my chronometer might be a bit fuzzy, despite my best efforts to keep it calibrated. Ah, look, migrating fins swimming beneath our hull... Fascinating, isn't it? Individually distinct, yet moving in such sublime harmony.",
        "char_1039_thorn2_CN_044": "Back then, Doctor, I was still aboard YOUR ship... I once considered dropping the anchor, ending my life of wandering, to settle on Rhodes Island. But no one can stay in one place forever, and every journey has its end. What truly matters is that we have each other in this moment.",

        "char_103_angel_CN_004": "Some people believe money can buy anything. But, uh-uh, that saying doesn't really apply to me. Wealth won't make a lick of difference to where my targets end up.",
        "char_103_angel_CN_005": "My first wish: more guns! We angels all have a patron firearm, a special gun we grow up with, but owning just one gun is kinda lame. I want eight more!",
        "char_103_angel_CN_006": "My second wish: get someone to turn off this light over my head!",
        "char_103_angel_CN_007": "I've always got Texas covered, that's why she lives so carefree. So obvious it goes without saying, right?",

A two-meter steel sword, a pair oversized paw-shaped woolly slippers... I mean, these quirky presents are clearly up to something! She must be expecting to see me make a fool of myself. Anyway, my present was picked out in earnest. Here, a solar-powered flashlight.",
        "char_107_liskam_CN_044": "And I'm done writing. I won't go wrong following this plan—by this time next year, Rhodes Island and I will have made even more notable progress. Restricted? Yes, I put editing privileges in place, or else Franka would've probably added her plans in too and made a whole mess of things.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_001": "Doctor, these are your tasks for the day. Yeah. A whole pile of work. Let's get to it.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_002": "Is Ifrit making trouble again? Sorry. I'll discipline her later.",

        "char_108_silent_CN_006": "Our biology research at Rhine Lab went so far as to implant Originium Shards into living bodies… Sorry, we'd better change the subject.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_007": "Saria? You mean she's here at Rhodes Island too? Is she here for Ifrit…? After she walked out on us like that, why would she come here right now…?!",

        "char_108_silent_CN_009": "Are you trying to cure Oripathy too? I heard that you were involved in the development of medical technology at Rhodes Island. Heheh… you must be looking forward to a breakthrough, as a researcher yourself.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_010": "…Asleep already? All right. I'll handle the rest of the work.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_011": "I am Olivia Silence, an Originium scientist from the Rhine Lab Medical Research Institute. My hope is to rid the world of Oripathy… even if it means risking my life in the process.",

        "char_108_silent_CN_013": "Is my medicine effective? Wonderful. This news brings me even greater joy than my promotion.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_014": "Doctor, I am looking forward to the day when the world is finally cured of Oripathy. In fighting and studying with you, I think that day may not be far off.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_017": "Understood. I'll focus on support.",

No, I haven't forgotten what day it is. This is just how I want to welcome the new year. Oh right, happy New Year.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_042": "Good day, Doctor.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_043": "Doctor, I have a proposal for your review: a new medical drone model. Oh, and I've heard it's your birthday. I didn't mean it like this, but hopefully you find it a practical gift.",
        "char_108_silent_CN_044": "There's no lack of ambition and idealism in the field of life sciences… I myself was drawn by those ideals before I found my true calling. But thanks to Rhodes Island, I now know what I'm researching and fighting for.",

        "char_109_fmout_CN_003": "Bear it in mind that excessive reliance on unfathomed power will eventually backfire on us.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_004": "Tarot cards aren't divine, all-seeing tools. Instead, we use them for guidance when we feel lost.",

        "char_109_fmout_CN_006": "Humans might never be able to escape this world... but we can change it. Our actions belie endless possibilities.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_007": "There are countless topics for which you can consult the tarot, the most common one being your luck in card games. To change it, however, you must be brave enough to change your fate first.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_008": "We have a ritual among diviners that's all the rage these days. We call it the 'Hand of Fate.' Would you like to try it?",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_009": "It's a divination taboo to do readings concerning death. But I don't believe death is the end—it's the beginning of something new.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_010": "Dreams can often enlighten you in strange ways. If you have an enlightening dream like that, you'd best remember every detail, Doctor.",

        "char_109_fmout_CN_013": "I'd already foreseen this promotion in my crystal ball. Heheh, just kidding.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_014": "You want to know your destiny, Doctor? Too bad, I can't help you. I'm not the one to share it with you, for the fate forbids me to do so.",

        "char_109_fmout_CN_036": "Want me to do a reading on your future? All right, please give me a minute.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_038": "Happy new year, Doctor. I bet you are eager to learn your fortune this year from me, aren't you? I have, truth be told, stolen a peek into it. My divination was reliable, as always. Still, only by unveiling the fate's mask with your own hands will you discover what lies beneath, don't you agree? No need to worry, I will be there to help you.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_042": "Doctor, you're blessed by the winds of luck.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor. As my birthday gift for you, I will answer any one question from you about the future. Yes, anything will be fine. I would like to remind you though, that I don't offer this knid of chance everyday, so think twice before you ask.",
        "char_109_fmout_CN_044": "There's no preordained path where one shall walk, nor predestined fate which one shall suffer. And everyone on Rhodes Island has proved that many, many times. Here, Doctor, Peek into the crystall ball. As long as your heart is not shadowed by the clouds, you will see the light of hope at the end of the haze.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_001": "Good morning, Doctor. Can I paint a portrait of you? And don't worry, I'll try not to... bring it to life. Besides, it's not like I can bring everything to life, you know.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_002": "Maybe I wasn't supposed to appear here?…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_003": "Doctor... what color are you, reflected in my eyes?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_004": "There are lots of fun, creative things here at Rhodes Island. I'm feeling inspired…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_005": "See my lovely 'assistants'? Hehe… What? You think they're scary? But, but they're so cute!",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_006": "Heh, so these are the colors of your soul…? Alright then, look at me. And paint me in those colors, your colors.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_007": "That's right. Even if no one understands me, I'll keep making art. No matter what kinds of monsters my works might become…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_008": "We artists are a unique breed… We spend at least thirty days a month stuck in a rut, thinking all our work is trash. And we only make any progress when inspiration strikes after midnight.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_009": "In the end, the mottled world sleeps peacefully in the dark depths—Yes, that's the true color of the ocean. Black is the only color you see? Looks like I still have more to share with you…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_010": "Are you... dreaming? Is the world in your dreams as colorful as the beings of this world, Doctor…?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_011": "I'm Deepcolor, a painter. Yes, just a 'painter', nothing more.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_012": "What's this unsettling feeling...?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_013": "Um, could you just... stop caring about me? If you keep treating me so well... I-I don't know what I might become…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_014": "Thank you, Doctor. Now, let's complete this work of art, shall we?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_017": "You're sending me to fight? Seriously?!",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_018": "I can't lead so many people.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_019": "Do your best, everyone!",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_020": "Is that who we're fighting?!",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_021": "Me?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_022": "What do I do?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_023": "Scumble-scumble...",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_024": "Aww, I just need a minute!",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_025": "No need to rush.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_026": "Let's take it slow.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_027": "You'll have to get past my 'assistants' first.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_028": "Can you defeat my little ones?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_029": "If you really make me mad... you won't like what happens next.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_030": "Let me sketch these triumphant heroes.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_031": "Aw, got my clothes dirty again...",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_032": "If only battles were like sketches. I'd just erase that one and redo it…",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_033": "This room's got a nice design.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_034": "Hm?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_036": "Doctor, since we happen to have some time off, want to see my latest work?",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_038": "Happy New Year, Doctor. What colors do I see for the coming year? Hm… the aroma of food, smiling operators, and presents full of kindness… a warm, tender turmeric? It's like nothing I've ever felt. I have to get this onto a canvas.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_042": "Good morning, Doctor.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_043": "Here's a hand-drawn birthday card. Do you like it? Heheh. I have two birthdays myself, in a way. I achieved a new form, after accepting the gift. Here, Doctor, look—I created this color, but it is entirely yours.",
        "char_110_deepcl_CN_044": "What day is it? Oh, of course. I see my 'assistants' are all joining in on the fun. Alright, why don't we let them make an even more beautiful piece for Rhodes Island?",
        "char_112_siege_CN_001": "You're still not done assigning tasks? I'll wait a bit longer then.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_002": "Keep calm and carry on.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_003": "Our meals used to be fairly nice in the past... but the quality's gone downhill since we joined Indra's group.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_004": "I had a dream... a dream where the sun rises, and in the distance beyond the horizon... there was my hometown. The place I might never get to return to, ever again.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_005": "Before I knew it, I'd gotten accustomed to this drifter's life... It's a strange thing. In the past I never imagined this was how I'd end up.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_006": "Gawain and company? I wouldn't say they ran into me, more like they picked me up off the streets.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_007": "I used to stand side by side with Indra's team when we fought in the streets of Victoria... Looking back, I suppose it's a fairly fond memory to me.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_008": "Stay on your guard! I know you've done the best you can, but there may be unknown dangers beyond our abilities.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_009": "If we're ever put in a tough situation... then I may well act on my own motives. And if it comes to that, Doctor, I hope you'll join me too in... no, never mind for now.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_010": "Hm? You fell asleep?... I wonder if you ever dream of your hometown, too.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_011": "I've passed the strength test, right? So assign me some missions. Don't let this hammer get too bored. My codename? They call me the Siege. Curious name, but it's got a nice ring to it.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_012": "Feels pretty good.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_013": "A promotion? Interesting...",
        "char_112_siege_CN_014": "Another promotion? All right, thanks... Life is strange like that, you know? Once upon a time, I was the one assigning new ranks to people.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_017": "Tell me, is this battle inevitable?",
        "char_112_siege_CN_018": "You'd better get used to my combat style.",

        "char_112_siege_CN_022": "Are you ready?",
        "char_112_siege_CN_023": "What a pain.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_024": "We'll take them out all at once.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_025": "My weapon chooses its worthy wielder.",

        "char_112_siege_CN_034": "Tsk...",
        "char_112_siege_CN_036": "It's too noisy out there for my tastes... I think the silence of your office suits me more. Let me stay in here for a bit, will you?",

        "char_112_siege_CN_038": "It's like I can hear an all-too-familiar chime again... I hope the new year's sun will be enough to tear through the hazy Londinium skies.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_042": "Oh, it's you, Doctor.",
        "char_112_siege_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor. I look back fondly on the way I used to celebrate this sort of thing with Indra and the gang. We'd drink ourselves half to death, right on the street, and make a racket to match, but that doesn't seem so appropriate now... Still, I've got some lollipops on me. Want one?",
        "char_112_siege_CN_044": "Doctor, as a leader, do you ever find yourself confused too? Do you feel the same heavy burden when your choices can impact the fates of so many? I'm not one to flee from my duty, but there is so much that requires careful consideration... I may want some guidance from you.",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_001": "Truthfully, I've thought up countless possibilities about coming back here, looking out at the same scenery that she saw that day... But I never could have imagined that I'd actually be standing here with you. Heh, It's just too outrageous, 'Doctor.'",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_002": "Where'd I go? Can't tell you. Kal'tsit bypassed you and gave me a secret order... I'm lying? Oh my, I'm almost touched by how much you trust her. Fine, fine. I just went to splurge on a bunch of clothes, that's all. And I've already gone through inspection. What, are you surprised?",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_003": "Some of your little cuties are always glaring at me through gritted teeth. But when are they actually gonna find the balls to pick a fight...? Kal'tsit already explained the situation? They're dealing with it? C'mon, show some respect for the needs of your staff. Just let 'em come at me. I'm bored out of my skull here anyway.",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_004": "You used to like working with us mercs a whole bunch. Mercenaries are efficient instruments of war. Just like fast food, ready to eat and easily disposable. You want to know what happened in the past? Hmm, some people would prefer I keep my mouth shut about that topic. Say, it must be such a blessing to not remember anything, right?",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_005": "Save the Infected? Almost all the Sarkaz in Kazdel are infected, and you haven't even seen the kinds of oppression and conflict that go on there... So, how far do you plan to go with this 'salvation'? You got Kal'tsit, who can't even protect ONE single Sarkaz. And you, a goddamned hooded amnesiac. Now, tell me, what are you gonna do?",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_006": "Look at these fresh operators of yours, starry eyes, full of naïvety. Can't help but wonder, if they had to watch those kind and gentle folk die, one by one, would they still do things the same way, with the same old song and dance? Hey, I'm not trying to look down on anyone. I'm just reminding you, don't just go twisting her ideas into some stupid little joke.",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_007": "Hey you, ever noticed those little thingies Amiya wears? You do know that Kal'tsit is keeping stuff from you, right? Man, I thought you were super smart and observant and good at getting everyone to trust you, considering you don't remember a thing. Honestly, it's kinda weird that you can even trust other people. Makes me wonder what those two jerks would say if they saw you like this.",
        "char_113_cqbw_CN_008": "This place sure does get all kinds, huh? A lot more weirdos here than before. Oh, don't get me wrong. I don't give a shit what they're thinking. But I gotta say, Amiya's doing a pretty good job. At least she's working hard to become more like a certain someone, and I can't say I hate that.",

        "char_194_leto_CN_008": "What do I think? Ummm... first of all, you should stop treating us like kids. Come on, Doctor, you don't need to worry about us so much. If you have time, why don't you teach me a few more formulas for Anna's Math lessons? We've counted you as a friend all this time, so if there's really something bugging us, you'll definitely know.",

Mama's gotten much better lately, so she's been thinking of hosting one of our own in a couple of days. But it'll be too quiet with just the two of us, so she asked me if you might be interested?",
        "char_194_leto_CN_042": "Doctor, want a drink?",
        "char_194_leto_CN_043": "Happy birthday! Here's a honey cake for you, I even asked Lada to teach me how to make it. I snuck a piece for myself, and it's real tasty, so you should hurry and try some! Honey drunk? Oh, yeah, no wonder I've been filling a little dizzy for a while now... Ah, look out! The cake!",
        "char_194_leto_CN_044": "Here, a souvenir from my last trip. It's pretty good, so you gotta try some. Is it me, or did Rhodes get a lot more crowded since I was away? I don't care if you keep onboarding more people, but you'd better make sure the USSG's clubhouse stays as-is, got it?",
        "char_195_glassb_CN_001": "Greetings, I'm here for my shift… That's a peculiar look on your face. Do I seem so unreliable?",

        "char_196_sunbr_CN_042": "Doctor, you want something to eat?",
        "char_196_sunbr_CN_043": "Afternoon, Doctor... a big crowd kept me in the kitchen late last night, I had to make cakes in all different flavors... But I got the tastiest one I made right here. Happy birthday, Doctor! Say aahh—",
        "char_196_sunbr_CN_044": "Doctor! Come try the piroshki I baked! They're even tastier than before, right? Heheh, I'm growing up too, you know. And then Mama and Papa, and Zima and all my friends won't have to worry about me. I'm going to get even stronger!",

        "char_197_poca_CN_005": "People like Istina, who forgo the opiate that is entertainment in pursuit of greater knowledge, are quite rare. Even at a noble school like I attended. If she had been my classmate back then... No, it's no use thinking about that now.",

        "char_197_poca_CN_008": "Doctor, I wonder if you could ever understand? I was a victim, at times, I know. But at some point, I found myself an unconscious victimizer. And I even… 'indulged' in it... I... I can never forgive myself for that.",
        "char_197_poca_CN_009": "Doctor, is it easier to forget, when you're fully grown? When I come of age, will I be able to forgive myself? Will becoming as mature as you allow me to finally deal with the misery in my heart?",

Oh, I just remembered something. The USSG and I will be hosting a small private gathering this evening. You're more than welcome to join us, Doctor.",
        "char_197_poca_CN_042": "Doctor, it's great to see you.",
        "char_197_poca_CN_043": "We had to be extremely careful with our gifts at school. A slight mistake may just trigger a sizable scandal. But that's something I no longer need to worry about, and I can express myself however I wish. Happy birthday, Doctor. Gummy taught me how to bake these cookies. Thank you for taking care of us.",
        "char_197_poca_CN_044": "I may never be able to free myself from the nightmare. But since my arrival at Rhodes Island, I gradually found the courage to face it. It's all thanks to you and my friends at the USSG. You always stand by my side and lead the way... I believe one day, I will finally be able to start my life anew.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_001": "It's not the duty of a guard to stand here and do nothing. Why don't we chat a bit?",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_002": "With perfect positioning and a suitable environment, my letters will arrive just fine. After all, it's my job, right? I need to do well to survive.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_003": "Are you hungry? If you want something to eat, just say the word. I can't compete with Matterhorn in the kitchen, but I can at least cook a decent meal.",

        "char_198_blackd_CN_006": "Huh? There's a faint smell on the letters? No, you must be imagining things.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_007": "I owe my life to Master SilverAsh. If necessary, I would do anything for him.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_008": "You want me to transport... all these? That's a lot, Doctor! Come on, I'm not a miracle worker!",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_009": "Seems I'm no match for you. I suppose it's time to retire my business smile for now... *Ahem*... I'd like to show you my true face, from now on.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_010": "Doctor, there's a new message for... Ah, never mind.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_011": "Esteemed Leader of Rhodes Island, your ally—Courier of the Snow Realm—is here at your service. If you get into any sort of trouble during your contract with Master SilverAsh, just snap your fingers and I'll be there.",

        "char_198_blackd_CN_018": "I won't blemish the name of the Snow Realm.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_019": "Too bad some people just can't live and let live.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_020": "They'll pay for what they've done.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_021": "At your service.",

        "char_198_blackd_CN_026": "How's that?",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_027": "Haaaghh!",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_028": "Speeding up!",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_029": "I'll bring news of our victory to Rhodes Island right away!",

        "char_198_blackd_CN_032": "Let's get out of here first. Here, this way! Hurry!",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_033": "I'll greet my roommates and neighbors first.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_034": "How can I help?",

        "char_198_blackd_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_038": "Doctor, I've brought you some food from Kjerag to celebrate the New Year. They're still warm, so would you like to try...? Are they to your taste? D—Don't eat so many! The beastmeat isn't that easy to digest!",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_042": "Call me whenever you need me.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_043": "Doctor, happy birthday! I have a present for you. You'd like to open it now? How about guessing what's inside first? Mm-hm... Correct, it's a scent sachet! I hope when you're carrying it around, you can feel as though I'm by your side.",
        "char_198_blackd_CN_044": "It was Master SilverAsh's choice to partner with Rhodes Island, but I believed in his decision. And my days at Rhodes Island have proven not only how right he was, but also how trustworthy you are.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_001": "I've moved your belongings where you wanted. No worries, it wasn't heavy.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_002": "The shield is a symbol of a steadfast guardian.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_003": "I've been responsible for protecting Young Master SilverAsh... I mean, Master SilverAsh... ever since he was young.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_004": "It's not exactly polite to talk about Miss Enya behind her back, but... *sigh* I do pity Miss Enya for what she has suffered. She really deserves a better life.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_005": "If my shield gets damaged, I should take it to the artisan called Vulcan for repairs. Is that correct?",
        "char_199_yak_CN_006": "This is far beyond my expectation. That artisan is truly skilled. I need to thank her properly.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_007": "Life at Rhodes Island is fun. The Snow Realm is rather bland in comparison.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_008": "Master did send me to protect Ensia. But I honestly don't think she's the type who would sit there and ask to be protected.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_009": "I am slowly starting to understand why Master SilverAsh holds you in such high regard. Doctor, from this day, feel free to command me as your shield.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_010": "Sometimes, I suddenly start missing my life in the Snow Realm.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_011": "Ally, I salute you in true Snow Realm fashion. My codename is Matterhorn, and I am one of the guards dispatched here by Master SilverAsh.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_012": "You have my gratitude.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_013": "Thank you for the approval, Doctor. I am greatly flattered.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_014": "I will not step back, not even if this shield shatters the very next second. Not because of my loyalty, but because of my conviction.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_017": "At your service.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_018": "I am honored.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_019": "I shall protect the team.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_020": "All is ready.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_021": "I shall be your vanguard.",

        "char_199_yak_CN_026": "I'm not here just for show!",
        "char_199_yak_CN_027": "With my conviction, I shall bring any monster to its knees!",
        "char_199_yak_CN_028": "You don't have what it takes!",
        "char_199_yak_CN_029": "I wasn't even giving my all!",
        "char_199_yak_CN_030": "Their strikes can barely tickle me.",

        "char_199_yak_CN_032": "I should not have taken the enemies lightly. Now I pay the price.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_033": "Very nice room, this one. Furnished tastefully, with a peaceful atmosphere.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_034": "Mhmm.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_036": "This is my signature dish. How do you like it?",
        "char_199_yak_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_038": "It's only natural for a guardian to keep his eyes peeled on New Year's day. Troubles do not shy away from celebration days. Rather, they are more likely to jump on people when they let their guard down. Rhodes Island is a comparatively safe place, but you must not lower your defense, Doctor. Happy new year.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_042": "Good day, Doctor.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_043": "It's your birthday, Doctor, isn't it? No need to worry, for I dare not forget the date. It's just the gift I prepared... I'm really not sure if you are going to appreciate it... So please, Doctor, do me a favor and open it after I leave. Thank you.",
        "char_199_yak_CN_044": "I'm actually not familiar with what lies outside the Snow Realm, since most of my job was to simply perform the duties my master has entrusted to me. I need to broaden my horizon. Even though I'm no more than a guardian, I need to learn more and see more.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_001": "Close your eyes, don't rush to open them. They may feel slightly hot, that's normal... Shh, stay calm, I crushed some herbs to help your eyes relax. You must have been staring at some dangerous thing. I do that a lot, trust me.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_002": "A guide...? I guess Simone is a better fit for the job. She's also a veteran hunter like me, so I know you'll be in good hands, and won't get into... trouble. There have been some misunderstandings and a few tribes now turn me away. Just remember, if anyone tells you I'm a man eater, they're lying.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_003": "Hands off. I've told you before, no one gets to touch my bow. Not you, not the smiths. You don't have the skills to hunt shadows in the depth of Sami, so you shouldn't draw their attention. I know your kind, I know you're curious. I'll just repeat myself over, over, and over again until I get through to you.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_004": "Check the logs from the research teams. See? These little hornbeasts are friends, they're harmless. And this kind of snow needs Arts to control, so call me if you run into some. Good, go ahead and add some notes to these pictures, you're pretty clever. Why the look? Is it so strange that I know how to use electronics?",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_005": "You all are strange, just like Magallan, insisting on comprehending the land on your own terms. I've seen your hard work, you'll come to know the whole of Sami as you see her in your dreams someday. But now? You aren't there yet. I'm worried about you, but since we're working together, just listen to me and you'll be fine.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_006": "Put that navigation instrument down, you're no professional, it's wearing you out just carrying it around. Let me lead the way, just like Arges used to do for me. She always says pitfalls and pains guide you to destiny, but I find I can get where I want by just following the sound of the breeze and the twigs in the trees.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_007": "You've never tried sleeping on a cave floor before? What about a bed made of vines? You should give it a try, I can't get a good night's sleep if I don't hear the heartbeat of Sami. How could I even close my eyes if I can't wake the moment I get a vision...? Yes, I have a lot of nightmares, what about it?",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_008": "...You called for me? Did you come across some trouble? If everything's fine, let me sit here alone for a while... I'm looking at the dead. The unsullied dead will walk among the beasts of the forest... I'm still looking for my parents.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_009": "Have I ever gotten lost? Hmm... Maybe. I left my home at first to find revenge, but when I saw all that sullied snow, I could only think to draw my bow and aim, to show the shadows that I was the true hunter. Can you be a hunter, too? Or can you be a companion to carry me out of danger when I'm hurt?",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_010": "Does the Doctor have the same kind of dreams that I do? Hm, probably not, we aren't in Sami, after all... Lucky enough for you, the shadows won't be chasing you through your dreams then.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_011": "If you come across any abnormalities while we're working together, I'll take care of them for you... Codename? Typhon is my only name. I found it on the horn ornament my mother left behind. Some people say it sounds scary, though.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_012": "Are you trying to show off your camera skills? No...? But how can you even call this combat experience, if you don't experience it yourself?",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_013": "Um, what's this promotion badge for again? If it's useless in combat, then let's wait until we settle the danger right in front of us, then you tell me the story behind it.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_014": "Many travelers to Sami find death in avalanches caused by loud boasting, or other arrogant behavior. They never even get a chance to see Sami's shadow. You won't make the same kind of mistake, not with me accompanying you.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_017": "Take these weapons and tools. We need them more than extra hands.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_018": "Got it, I'll take the lead. Don't be nervous, I can handle this.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_019": "Stay close, don't run off.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_020": "Don't let them out of sight, even if your eyes are hurting.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_021": "Stay calm and make your move. No need to worry, I've got your back.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_022": "What do you need of me?",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_023": "Time to choose our prey.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_024": "Good timing.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_025": "I'll pin you to your shadow.",

        "char_2012_typhon_CN_027": "Nature should not be disturbed.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_028": "Get out of my home!",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_029": "Each of my arrows slows the black that taints the Sami snow.",
        "char_2012_typhon_CN_030": "I see you managed to complete a mission without causing any unnecessary pain to the quarry. Um, not bad, not bad. Sip a hot drink and get some rest.",

        "char_209_ardign_CN_042": "I'm right here, Doctor!",
        "char_209_ardign_CN_043": "Yay! Happy birthday, Doctor! Hm, something smells good. You got a gift from Melantha, didn't you? What a scent! Melantha taught me how to make perfume, actually, do you want to try with me?",
        "char_209_ardign_CN_044": "I promise I'll be more careful, I won't break anything! Sorry… Honestly, my salary won't even be enough to cover the damages if I keep breaking things… heheh…",

If possible, Doctor, I really wish to give you a tour of my hometown. But, the wilds there are dangerous on snowy days, and you'll need me as your guide.",
        "char_210_stward_CN_042": "Awaiting your instructions, Doctor.",

        "char_211_adnach_CN_005": "Not every Laterano has the right to use guns, rare weapons that they are. In my hometown, we're pretty good at making knockoff gun parts. The crossbow crafting industry is also on the rise. The result is what I have here - a crossbow with a tactical rail attachment.",
        "char_211_adnach_CN_007": "Would you like to try some of my handmade sweets? I'm kind of ashamed that I can only make 25 types of desserts. It feels like I've disgraced the Laterano people.",

        "char_264_f12yin_CN_004": "I built a library back in Mansfield. Most of the books I could get my hands on were Columbian, and thus, my extensive reading eventually brought a sense of monotony. It is most pleasing that Rhodes Island has such a diverse collection of books.",

They are all reasonable people, and the agreement I signed with Rhodes Island is also in line with their protocols, so they won't make things difficult for you.

        "char_290_vigna_CN_004": "I'm going exceptionally harsh on you, given I've been so nice to everyone else you say? Well, isn't it only natural? Those who shoulder the responsibility of management like you need more than their self-discipline to do their job, Doctor. I have high standards for myself, and I think it's only right for these standards to be applied to you as well.",

        "char_290_vigna_CN_007": "Wha?! It's pouring outside? I-I don't... believe it has anything to do with my outdoor concert! Now get aside if you hear me 'cause I'm setting off right NOW! I won't let this sprinkle dampen my passion by one bit!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_008": "You got an important mission you want me to handle? Hehee, you can count on me! Let's see here... 'You are to acquire the following products for Rhodes Island during a time-limited mega-sale...?' Th-that's impossible!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_009": "Even if the crowd starts booing, the show must go on. You can't quit in the middle of a performance just because you messed something up. Same is true for the Sarkaz and infected. We won't have anything left with us if we just call it quits.",

        "char_290_vigna_CN_012": "You gotta be willing to sweat a lot to keep up the battle tempo!",

        "char_290_vigna_CN_029": "No matter how tough the bad guys are, I won't stop strumming! Oh… 'fighting' might be the better word here!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_030": "You all deserve a commendation from me, oh, but not you, Doctor, not yet! Your job's not finished until I see everyone back home safe and sound.",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_031": "We're not out of trouble yet! Hold formation!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_032": "Ugh... This can't be it. We have to fight harder!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_033": "Is there a soundproof room here? My fingers are itching for guitar strings so BAD!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_034": "Hey! That just gave me a chill!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_036": "D-Don't pat me on the head! It might make me shorter!",

Here's an inside scoop for you: my guitar solo will close the concert at its climax! Hehe! Now that we have more and more operators with talents for music on Rhodes Island, who can say our future concert won't be a hit like that Obsidian Festival in Siesta!",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_042": "How can I help?",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor! A perfect time for everyone to get hyped-up, don't you think? How about we take the meeting room and hold a live concert there! Huh? Still a no, even on your birthday? Aargh… Well, but my song request service is still at your disposal. Oh, but guitar solo only, mind you.",
        "char_290_vigna_CN_044": "Life at Rhodes Island is like a piece of rock music. Surely there're low drum beats that keep us in suspense here and there, but the theme always catches us with our blood seething and souls resonating. Which kinda reminds me, that it's high time for me to wipe all the craps out with this guitar!... Er, I mean a more creative, musical way, not really wiping the board with it...",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_001": "Dr. {@nickname}, I made a really strong brew with our new coffee machine. Wanna try? You can only have one cup a day, though. Don't want you up all night!",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_002": "Being a Messenger isn't easy. Both the sender and the receiver might have some big ideas, and who knows if some shady secrets get inside your bag. If you're too absorbed in getting yourself moving, you could still end up in a pit for what you get yourself into.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_003": "My mother was from Higashi, so my name doesn't sound very Siracusan. A lot of people ask me if it's even my real name, so I decided to use Angelina as a codename too.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_004": "Good morning, Dr. {@nickname}! Yeah, I'm off to send out some documents. Dr. Kal'tsit says my skills could come in super useful in battle... but compared to fighting, I kinda prefer taking letters where they belong!",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_005": "I actually don't know if I'm a good fit for Rhodes Island... I mean, a lot of really heavy stuff happens here, I'm not sure I can handle it. Croissant's always comforting me, but I am still not sure about myself. Do I really have what it takes?",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_006": "I don't feel lost anymore. At the end of the day, it's more than a simple identification with you or Rhodes Island. If I can leap across the gaps between skyscrapers as a Messenger, then I know I could  bridge the gap between the Infected and Uninfected as an Operator!",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_007": "Memories are precious. I always remember that the Infected, just like us, look forward to a better tomorrow. I don't know anything about your past, Dr. {@nickname}, but I promise to help you recall.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_008": "Dr. {@nickname}, don't be shy, come closer! That's right! Three, two, one, sorridi! See? It's a photo sticker of you and me. The perfect souvenir, right? I guess it's also a token of… some of my feelings, haha.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_009": "The view from the deck is great. Especially for stargazing! See that lone star over there? People say that one day, its companion star will appear, and then they'll embrace and dance together. Still... how long does it have to wait for the other one to show up? And how long do I have to wait... for the star to wink back at me?",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_010": "Umm hmm~♪ Mmm, maybe the coral lipstick suits me more.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_011": "Ciao! I'm Angelina Ajimu, a Messenger from Siracusa. Just call me Angelina. Am I cool to call you Dr. {@nickname}?",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_012": "The battlefield is a cruel place... but I'll try not to let you down.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_013": "Since you trust me, Dr. {@nickname}, I'll have to work much, much harder than I usually do! Like, Siracusan Messengers always say: 'A slow Messenger gets caught by the wind.'",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_014": "I've made my decision. As long as you're still working to help the Infected, Dr. {@nickname}, I'll follow you. You've come so far, done so much... now it's my turn to do something for you.",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_017": "In work or in battle, I'll give it all I've got!",

        "char_291_aglina_CN_030": "We all worked hard for this. You'll cherish this victory, won't you Dr. {@nickname}?",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_031": "Well, even I lose a letter sometimes...",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_032": "The more difficult the situation, the harder we have to try!",

        "char_291_aglina_CN_043": "{@nickname}, close your eyes... Keep this a secret just between the two of us, okay? Hold my hand tight now... Do you feel floaty? Look, {@nickname}! Don't the stars seem closer?",
        "char_291_aglina_CN_044": "When I left home and came to Rhodes Island, I left behind my old friends and the life I knew too. I've grown up a little now, but... I'd be fooling myself if I said it wasn't hard. Doctor, I still believe it's all worth it. Because right here, I've found a star to call my own.",
        "char_293_thorns_CN_001": "Drink this, before you start working. Good. That medication will keep you up as long as it's in your system. I trust you'll stay focused, won't you?",

Why are you staring at my hair, Doctor...? It's frazzled? Don't worry about it. Wouldn't be the first time my experiment has failed, or the second.",

        "char_293_thorns_CN_006": "If you are not a follower of the Laterano religion, it is best not to go to Iberia. Their so-called 'purest faith' is rooted in that land. The people there are so pious, even the Laterans feel ashamed among them. As for me? None of that concerns me in the slightest.",
        "char_293_thorns_CN_007": "Doctor, have you learned any of the history of the Iberian Penal Battalion? If you've heard even anything remotely relevant, you should know that the inhabitants of that land are far crazier than their cold, plain gray buildings suggest.",
        "char_293_thorns_CN_008": "The angle of attack, the path of evasion, and the posture of defense. Every action is calculated, and no effort is wasted. This is what they call 'La Destreza.' Don't you think this is similar to your command style, Doctor?",

        "char_293_thorns_CN_011": "So you're the Doctor? I'll keep this brief then. Code name: Thorns. Starting today, I'll be assuming my post. Yes? My trouser leg is rolled up...? Pay it no mind; this happens a lot.",

        "char_293_thorns_CN_044": "Doctor, I know Rhodes Island has always been curious about Iberia, but no two Iberians can give the same recount, just as no two swordsmen will perform the same la Destreza.

        "char_328_cammou_CN_042": "Hiii~",
        "char_328_cammou_CN_043": "Doctor, have you heard of montages? It's when you mix a bunch of different shots from different scenes together.

That's how it goes, but our finances have been in a sorry state these past few years. The justice of guarding others with the faith we harbor—surely the Lord permits us that.",
        "char_332_archet_CN_003": "Doctor, do you have any interest in beer or bread? Landen Monastery Fermented Goods Contest CCCLXXVII first-place winner, at your service! No need? Ah, alright... Truly, I want our soft, springy bread and fragrant beer to be known across all of Terra. That would do wonders for our revenues!",
        "char_332_archet_CN_004": "E—Exusiai? The legend who blew up her alma mater seventeen times in three years? I never thought she'd be here at Rhodes Island...

I'm very proud, but occasionally I'll remember the days gone past, where I simply drew my bow, and loosed. Now, every arrow has become so much more weighty.",
        "char_332_archet_CN_007": "So as to rebuild the Monastery, my sisters have left to seek cooperation across all of Terra. Landen Monastery, age-old guardian of Laterano, is now a dispatch agency... If only those old men would grant a little more funding. What kind of an excuse is 'better to have a nun trained than a fund gained!?'",
        "char_332_archet_CN_008": "Rhodes Island is a far cry from Laterano, mingling the breadth of diversity in vision and ambition together. It's truly remarkable. Doctor, you must consider coming to the Monastery to teach after you retire. Issues of faith? That'll be no problem! None of us will mind.",
        "char_332_archet_CN_009": "At the start of spring, we'll prune the overgrown vines, and then open up the cellar come evening and retrieve the wine. The moment the setting sun catches through our glasses, we'll down them in one gulp. Ceremony? No, it's just a custom of ours. Life and faith became one long ago, and we don't want to lose it, that's all.",

        "char_332_archet_CN_012": "I see, so this is how Rhodes Island's operators fight! Truly, they're exemplary!",
        "char_332_archet_CN_013": "A promotion? My greatest thanks. Hm? I seem at peace? Of course. When you spend five years partaking in commendation ceremonies for outstanding clerics where all peers are absent due to hangovers, these things don't get to you much.",
        "char_332_archet_CN_014": "Another promotion? Hmm... all the companies outside seem to strongly emphasize a hierarchical structure. Well, seeing as my excellence has been commended, might Rhodes Island be interested in establishing a long-term cooperation agreement with our Monastery?",

        "char_332_archet_CN_018": "Cooperating with my Sisters, everyone always drowned each other out... but under my command, things may be a little terser. I'll do my utmost.",

        "char_332_archet_CN_030": "Now that I joined in this battle, nobody will think Landen Monastery's just an ornament of Laterano, will they?",
        "char_332_archet_CN_031": "Errrr… Please allow me the chance to remedy this! This is my mistake, and in no way represents the Monastery!",
        "char_332_archet_CN_032": "Were battles beyond the walls... always so cruel?",
        "char_332_archet_CN_033": "It's too stifling in here. There's near to none of the Monastery's sunshine!",

        "char_332_archet_CN_036": "Ah, Doctor, I've been thinking whether I should invite you with me to come see Laterano. Perhaps you'd have more interest in the Monastery then…",

        "char_332_archet_CN_038": "Hm, there may be plenty of Lateran citizens here, but everyone's natures and backgrounds are so at odds with each other. I just want to find a fellow countryman I can calmly pray and toast to the New Year with, but... they're all so…",
        "char_332_archet_CN_042": "May the Lord bless you, Doctor.",
        "char_332_archet_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor. This is a special day of great importance, and I offer you my most heartfelt prayers. May the bell sound to hold sickness and misfortune at bay, and may faith light your way. Also, I'd like you to accept this gift from me—an exquisite copy of a business contract, with all to gain and naught to lose!",
        "char_332_archet_CN_044": "A good business partner is one thing, but a companion with whom you can uphold your faith is far more valuable. The weight of drawing one's bow for justice... I am sure all people of Rhodes Island can understand it. Long may the bells sound, that we continue to fight side by side, Doctor.",

        "char_333_sidero_CN_003": "You want to learn more about Minoan culture? I see, I'll put together a report for you. No, that's not information I can cover in just a few words. I must report it to you in detail.",

If you can't keep up with the newest information, you could end up falling into the hands of enemies using the new methods, so there's absolutely no room to slack. I hope you understand this, Doctor. Doctor?",
        "char_333_sidero_CN_005": "What did that Minoan girl in the garden do...? My head feels strangely empty, it's like I'm completely relaxed… This doesn't... seem normal to me. Doctor, I need to rest. I'm sorry, I'm out of service as your bodyguard for the time being…",
        "char_333_sidero_CN_006": "Hoooooo, HAH! Looks like I'm in pretty good shape today, maybe it'll feel even better to exercise a bit with the reserve operators. Oh, it's Hell Week? Alright then, I'll have to bug Dobermann again and get her to find a place for me.",
        "char_333_sidero_CN_007": "Corinia was built on the scales of merchants. Everyone there wants to squeeze as much as they can out of everyone else. But, people in the other city-states are a lot more interesting. I had all kinds of fun back when I was guarding them. The feeling was a lot like what I get with you, Doctor.",
        "char_333_sidero_CN_008": "You need to train properly, Doctor. Not exactly, stretching and walks are light exercise. What I'm talking about is real training. It requires a full range of intense exercises, as well as a healthy diet to burn fat and build muscle. Oh, you're fine with that? Good, let me see your results then. Don't be like last time—Hey! I'm not done talking yet, get back here!",
        "char_333_sidero_CN_009": "Finished that one too? Want one more bowl? No problem. This is the first time I've made a complete meal. Usually I just fill my belly with some rations and don't cook much. Here's the last portion. When you're done, you'll exercise just like we agreed. That's the whole reason I learned to do this.",

        "char_366_acdrop_CN_043": "You're still working? Let's go get some exercise outside. Wait, you volunteered for overtime? Doctor, ain't no point in workin' this much. Life only begins once you clock out! C'mon, what do you wanna eat? It's on me.",
        "char_366_acdrop_CN_044": "I used to skate to ditch class n' get away from the adults. Then, it was to lose the cops when I was out tagging. I said I did it in the name of freedom, but thinkin' back, I guess that was kinda selfish. We fight harder for other people's freedom than our own, don'tcha think? Like what we're doin' here.",

        "char_367_swllow_CN_008": "Why are you called 'Doctor?' No, I'm not trying to get you to remember anything, it's just that title makes me very... wistful. Looking at all the Infected around you... Brings to mind a little bit of the past.",
        "char_367_swllow_CN_009": "I've known the whole time. When my mother brought me to Rhodes Island, she'd already lost her mind. I didn't feel the pain her inner conflicts caused her, but I can relate to it, because I relied on that obsession to get me to where I am today. Only now, I've found a new direction... I want to find her, and I want to save her.",

This is bread my mum baked, these biscuits are from my oldest brother, and my sister cured this meat—she's eighth-oldest. I think that's mostly it. Don't be shy, let's tuck in together! ...Eep! Did I accidentally shock you again, Doctor?",

Well, how about I trim a new hairstyle for you? Mm-hm! Great, let's do it!",
        "char_377_gdglow_CN_044": "Doctor, look, I can control my static away from my staff now! Maybe with a bit more time, I'll be able to master my Arts. Then I can hug my mum all I want, without having to worry about shocking her! Mm-hm, I need to keep at it!",

Or maybe it's in the currency of some small, remote country? It's not? It's Lungmen Dollars? I-I-I-I see... Nonono, I-I'm just a-a-a little surprised, hehehe...",
        "char_383_snsant_CN_005": "Oripathy... Hm, even though it's a bit outside my field of study, it might be worth looking into... But if I add another research project, I'll go from two meals a day to two days a meal... Aww…",

Before I went back to Lungmen, I turned down a big retention fee from the research institute, so my self-funded research project went under... But, it's more important to be home.

Then I want to grow up soon.",

Even after I was out of ammo, I was still mechanically pulling the trigger over and over, until the coach took away the launcher in my hand. That's right. A launcher, not a gun.",
        "char_4006_melnte_CN_008": "I once thought about opening a sundries shop like my parents did. Once, I even had an agreement with a landlord. Then, I had nightmares that entire night... Now? Much better. I'm even trying to help Instructor Dur-nar—Oh, please don't tell anyone about this.",
        "char_4006_melnte_CN_009": "My father used to tell me stories of how the great Blacksteel founder upgraded their firearms. But it wasn't until recently that I realized true greatness is not to popularize some kind of weapon. Instead, it's to make weapons useless forever. Right, it's very ironic. This is what I dream of achieving, and it is something that I can only dream of achieving.",

        "char_4006_melnte_CN_013": "The only way my former employer expresses approval is by raising wages—Don't get the wrong idea. For every wage increase, they make you do ten times the work afterwards. That's not how Rhodes Island works, right?",
        "char_4006_melnte_CN_014": "Thank you for your trust, Doctor. I used to think of Rhodes Island as a stopping point so beautiful that it's almost unreal, but it now seems I will have to extend my stay here for a little longer.",

        "char_4009_irene_CN_004": "I make the other Iberian Operators nervous? To fear the Inquisition is to fear the law. Isn't that only natural? Unless... Some of our Ægirs have their reasons to dodge my gaze. I'll make it clear now. I can't promise I won't fight them.",

No, I couldn't feel anything... until I killed another Sea Terror. I finally realized that I fought only because I wanted to live. Isn't that just like Iberia today?",
        "char_4009_irene_CN_009": "All I did was sprain my shoulder on my last mission. The bite wound the mission before that's almost all healed up, too. Stop selling me short!

        "char_4009_irene_CN_010": "We're still in deep water, and you managed to fall asleep in a blink of an eye? It makes me wonder if I should be jealous... Fine, you can have your rest for now. I'll be waiting here.",

Because of the situation in Iberia, I've never had the breathing room to celebrate someone's birthday, but you gave me this moment of reprieve, and I have to put it to good use. Here, pick your favorite piece of music. We'll start with that.",

Your shirt collar is so wrinkled. You are not going to attend the party like that, right? Go back and sort that out, I'll wait here for you.",
        "char_400_weedy_CN_042": "How do you do, Doctor.",
        "char_400_weedy_CN_043": "Doctor, have you seen Leaf? Her signal suddenly dropped, and my terminal indicates she's somewhere around your office—You thought she was a present and put her away?

        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_003": "I've taken care of those tasks—effortlessly, I might add. No need to thank me. That would give the impression I've exerted myself over such trivial matters.

I was just chatting with Laqeramaline—or rather, with the incantations woven by the Banshees, reminiscing about the riverside landscapes I've traversed.

Good question. How indeed?",

        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_009": "Indeed, my interrogations are truly gentle. As long as enough blood flows, I can thoroughly sift through a heart and excavate all the secrets I wish to know.

        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_014": "Ah, a medal... Have you thought it through? I'm rather fussy when it comes to gifts and the ones handing them over. The vows between Canoes come first, so I can't do much for Rhodes Island... But if a friend has a personal favor to ask, I don't mind lending a hand at times.",
        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_017": "I don't mind escorting this many people at once.",

        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_038": "How rare to see everyone in the mood to celebrate a holiday, rather than to mourn someone. It's also rare to see a banquet hall prepare a seat for a Vampire.

Some sisters choose to commemorate the day they killed an archenemy as their birthday; others pick the day their blood was purified and they became pure Vampires. How about you? Since coming to this great land, the blood you've shed and the pain you've endured… how much do you remember?",
        "char_4010_etlchi_CN_044": "Farewells are difficult, so we must strive to minimize our partings. This isn't my personal conviction, but it was the reason Rose Riverside rallied behind Theresa, and why I support you now. Very well, present your year-end retrospective. I find solace in hearing memories unfold.",

        "char_4011_lessng_CN_004": "The bindings on this sword? There are some on my body as well. They tighten my joints and keep my muscles taut, preventing my mind from slacking off. They are not just for show.",
        "char_4011_lessng_CN_005": "It doesn't matter if a weapon is easy to wield or not, I'd find a way to wield this sword even if it were twice as big. A Leithanian noble can have multiple violin bows made to order, but commoners might only have sticks to use... and we can't depend on others to protect us.",

        "char_4011_lessng_CN_008": "The more engrossed you get reading up on things, the stranger your mood becomes... If you're feeling moody, a little throwing or smashing might help you vent it out. I'll take care of the clean up afterward... You're saying that, you were restless because I was staring at you as your mind wandered...? I'll go check if dinner's ready.",

        "char_4013_kjera_CN_004": "Enya... Enya? Doctor, have you seen Enya? It's about time we return to Kjerag, and with all the things that need her attention, she has to come with us. Just where has that girl scurried off to now...?",

Standing at the summit above the clouds amidst the mountains, seeing the sun once again is a heavenly feeling. You'll love it—ah, but there is the chance you'll freeze to death before then. Tricky, that...",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_008": "Enya's attitude towards her brother, well... I'm sure you understand—the opposite of intimacy isn't hatred, but indifference. And she likes to say as much, though it's not actually quite that bad between them. That said, in time... I have no clue at all.",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_009": "The world outside sprawls vast and far, Doctor. But I've come to realize something. It's like people are the same no matter where you go.

        "char_4013_kjera_CN_029": "Doctor, you can't be overzealous in challenging your limits, or you might hurt yourself.",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_030": "What a splendid job, Doctor! You make me want to pat you on the head~",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_031": "Now, now, it's alright. These are fine enough results, aren't they?",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_032": "Doctor, fear not. I'm here.",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_033": "Let's see, here's... whereabout is this?",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_034": "Oh?!",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_036": "Doctor, would you like to go on a walk together?",

        "char_4013_kjera_CN_038": "Oh, so this holiday's far more widespread than just a Kjerag celebration. No, I don't think it's too strange. I just feel like once one holiday's over, you blink and the next one's already here. How curious. Still, any reason to be happy's a good reason. Doctor, would you like some cheese fondue?",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_042": "Doctor! Did you sleep well last night?",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_043": "Doctor, happy birthday! Come have a taste of this cake I made, or maybe blow out the candles and make a wish first? Oh, and put on this medicinal garland, it'll bless any children to live a hundred years free of ailments! You're not little anymore, you say? Heheh, Doctor, what are you telling me.",
        "char_4013_kjera_CN_044": "Without even noticing it, I've racked up an awful lot of visits here with Enya. I must say, Doctor, I'm gradually starting to understand why Enya loves to scurry over here when she's free. You see, this is a place full of interesting, adorable people. To where will you lead this sailing ship? I'd love to see for myself.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_001": "Assistant? File Work? Not sure I followed. Anyway, I found a nice-looking mountain with a great view the other day. Want to see it?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_002": "This makes no sense. Why did you build so many walls and corridors? They block your vision. A mad burdenbeast could crash into this little room without any warning, and you don't seem to be a bit conerned. Danger can be prowling at any corner and you must stay on your guard. That's what Agnese taught me.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_003": "You call the outside 'the wilds', but you can find everything out there. Put in a little effort and you'll find food and water just fine. But in the city, there are no places to hunt. How do you even survive?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_004": "Um, Doctor, have you ever been to one of those 'parties' Exusiai talks about? They're scary! Those little balls of exploded plant seeds, those sweet, smooth milk puffs! Listen, this is not how you should live... What? They're having another party today? I wanna go.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_005": "Agnese told about a dangerous scent on Rhodes Island, but she and the pack would stay with me. Hmm? You can't see her? But she was just here a moment ago... Maybe she went to go get food?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_006": "The man named Bernardo died, and Zaaro ran back to his territory with his tail between his legs... Seems like the hunt Agnese told us about is in the bag. But still she doesn't look happy. Why? The pack has more than enough food.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_007": "Can I get a couple extra sets of Rhodes Island clothes? They're well-made, very warm, make good tents, and you can tear them up for bandages. No? Awww… Then how about the storage depot? I'd like to go and... uhh, take a look around.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_008": "Doctor, Agnese spoke highly of you, and told me to learn from your 'cunning.' What does cunning mean? Oh! Is it cunning when you hide here by yourself, eating in secret, not sharing with anyone else? I don't think that's hard to do.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_009": "Recently, I've started thinking that maybe life under a roof isn't so bad. Here, you are not a pack, you don't group up and subject yourself to one another. You're, well, something strange... Ugh! It doesn't make any sense! Anyways, I'll stay here a few more days! So get me something good to eat!",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_010": "Asleep? That means nothing for me to do? Agnese, let's go play outside.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_011": "Agnese called me Lunacub, so you can call me that too. I heard there's a 'canteen' place here, where you can eat whatever you want. Is that true? Where is it? Can I go there right now?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_012": "Too much trouble! Hunting really isn't that complicated.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_013": "A promotion? Does that mean you'll listen to me? How many of these shiny... 'medals' does it take for you to obey me?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_014": "Agnese always tells me that humans are dangerous and cunning, their bellies full and hearts wicked, but you've proved you are different. You are allowed to join my pack.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_017": "I still prefer hunting with my pack. They are much more open than humans.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_018": "Since I'm the luna wolf, you all must listen to me. I'll make it clear first: if I don't see your fangs bared in the hunt, you won't get a share of the kill.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_019": "How much will we bring back today?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_020": "The hunt begins.",

        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_025": "Pipe down already! I'm not going to miss!",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_026": "Take down their packleader!",

        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_030": "Tired. Already did what you asked me. Can I go eat now? What's on the menu today?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_031": "Hey! Some of them just got away! Do you even know how to keep the prey surrounded? I'm gonna teach you next time!",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_032": "Grr... Agnese, the hunt failed. Come help us! Don't let this idiot die here!",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_033": "I don't like roofs.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_034": "Don't scare me like that! You wanna die?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_036": "Hey, Doctor, don't you get tired of staying in these little cubes every day?",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_038": "Hmm? Is today special? A new year? Don't get it. I think every day is brand new. Any day's worth celebrating as long as you get to fill your stomach. Anyway... Do you want to try the meat I roasted? It's very yummy.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_042": "What took you so long? Next time you make me wait for you in a stuffy little box, don't blame me if I get a little rude.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_043": "A birthday is the day you were born onto this land, right? That much I know. I found a meadow full of flowers yesterday. It smells very nice. I haven't told anyone else, so let's go. I've already planned out the route.",
        "char_4014_lunacu_CN_044": "To be honest, I still don't get what you people are trying to do. But I can see you're working to keep that rock-disease away from everyone, so that they can eat and drink all they want. I suppose it's probably a good thing. Another good thing, is I don't having to sleep with one eye open like I do outside. Here, I can sleep soundly.",
        "char_4015_spuria_CN_001": "No problem. Just leave the documents here, and I'll filter out anything that isn't worth you reading... Can't do it that way? We have to take each one seriously? Fine, fine, whatever you say.",

        "char_4015_spuria_CN_003": "How's my stay? So far so good. Here I can focus on reviewing my designs without headphones on my head. No need to block everything out with music. Feels kinda refreshing. Still, I haven't modded any of the equipment in the dorm myself, so it does feel kinda like we're missing some features here. For example, something that automatically orders cactus tarts takeout at preset times.",

Why don't I just go see her? Uhmm... The way I put it, one can't be so proactive with everybody. Sometimes, you need to keep a certain distance. You know what I mean?",

Their designs seem to have drawn inspiration from a variety of sources, all of which I'd like to try out. Oh, just so you know, I'm more of an order-by-phone kind of girl.

        "char_4015_spuria_CN_006": "I'm more willing to go on field ops than before? That's because I'm after inspiration for firearms upgrades. When I stand in war-torn ruins, where there's none of the ear-rending ruckus of Laterano, I get this weird sense of fear. I have to find a way to use my technology to combat that somehow.",
        "char_4015_spuria_CN_007": "If the Lateran Curia ever asks for me, make an excuse and turn them down, will you? I don't wanna go back to listen to my boss nag about faith and standing.

Yes, you're no Sankta and I can't feel your emotion, but that doesn't mean I can't care about you. Alright, eat up now. I wanna see if this is from the tainted batch.",
        "char_4015_spuria_CN_010": "You asleep...? Hehe... Well, well, seems like a good chance to release a drone in the hallway and stream someone's sleep-talking... No response? Looks like you're actually asleep.",

        "char_401_elysm_CN_008": "On the battlefield, few things are more important than morale. Do you see this banner? As a vanguard, just lifting it is enough to fill everyone with courage. Wait, Doctor, you didn't seriously believe that, did you? I was just joking, this thing's actually a communication device.",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_009": "Doctor, you've earned my trust. There's no need to be so humble. I know I'm a good judge of character. How about I call you my comrade-in-arms from now on? My captain and I used to be like oil and water, but look at us now. I believe that, much like her, you will eventually be moved by my sincerity. No? The captain sent you a letter complaining about me? What?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_010": "Doctor, the files over here are... Hm? Already asleep? Well, even if it's just me, you really shouldn't let your guard down like that.",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_011": "3rd Combat Squad, vanguard and communications specialist, Elysium, reporting in. We've always communicated through electronic means, I do believe this is our first time speaking face-to-face, Doctor?",

        "char_401_elysm_CN_013": "Thank you very much. I won't end up ranked higher than my captain if I get promoted again, will I?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_014": "I've always trusted my own judgment, Doctor. But if you're the one giving me orders, I won't question them for a second. After all, isn't that what it means to be a comrade-in-arms?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_017": "Of course, I'd love to.",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_018": "Don't worry, I'm just a stand-in. The captain's not here right now, after all.",

        "char_401_elysm_CN_027": "Now we'll see them!",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_028": "Let's get this done quick!",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_029": "This just confirms it. We really do make the best partners.",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_030": "Great teamwork. Give me five!",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_031": "If they've lost their fighting spirit, they're not our enemies anymore. Let's stop here.",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_032": "It's too dangerous! I'll be the last line of defense! Doctor, please give the order to retreat!",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_033": "Hm... Has this room been renovated?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_034": "What's up?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_036": "I've heard that if this tuft of red hair on my head falls out, it won't ever grow back. This is a very serious problem, Doctor.",

        "char_401_elysm_CN_038": "Hello, hello? Can you hear me...? Signal's fine, connection to the landship's all clear. Doctor, try to guess which comms station I'm calling from...? Doc's distracted! Now! Set off the fireworks! Heh-heh, what do you think, Doctor? Now that's a passionate New Year's celebration, isn't it?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_042": "Hey, Doctor! Got any missions for me today?",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor. I've meticulously prepared this year's gift, taking into consideration everything I've learned. This time, you'll be blown away by... W-Wait, hold on, Doctor, don't leave! I swear, it's not a prank this time!",
        "char_401_elysm_CN_044": "Rhodes Island's a lot busier now than when I first arrived. We keep finding more and more trustworthy companions, and I think I'm not the only one drawing complaints anymore. I'm deeply moved, so I painstakingly edited up an audio reel of everyone being drunk at last year's party! I hope it gets some enthusiastic reactions!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_001": "Here are the documents. If that's all, I'll be going... The stain on that sheet? Oh, that's, uh... I guess I did spill something when I was having a couple of drinks last night. Haha... Damn, I put it in the middle of the stack, how'd you catch it...?",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_002": "Do cultured folks like you even drink? Come, come, let's take a swig together, okay? Climb the hills in the dark, cross the desert in a storm. Now we gather in the oasis, drinking all the finest booze… Hehehe, oh, my friend, let's return to our homeland…",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_003": "Why are you all wrapped up like that on such a warm day? You'll be drenched in sweat. Hey you! Yes, you! Why don't you take off that jacket? A true warrior isn't afraid to show the results of hard training!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_004": "'Operator'? No, I'm a warrior of Rhodes Island. Don't worry, it's not because I can't let go of the past, but because I want to defend the present. I'll train new warriors for you... same as I was taken in and raised back on the sands.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_005": "I once took in some war orphans. They begged me to teach them how to use a sword to get revenge. I agreed, and they succeeded, but at the cost of their lives… Many years ago, the chief taught me that the sword is only for protection.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_006": "The war took the lives of everyone in my tribe. My friends blocked blows with their bodies, and the chief's blood dripped onto my head... Me and the other children set out on a path of revenge. I'm the only one left. No one and nothing else. Only me.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_007": "The mark I'm drawing on your forearm? It's a 'bite mark'. Look, I have one too. The chief carved it into my skin herself. She said that those who have undergone the trial of blood and pain become the bravest warriors. The mark brings us strength.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_008": "I've taken plenty of hits both in battle and in the mines, but not many left marks. I used to think I was lucky, but now I wish I wasn't. I want the scars to help me remember certain people and things. Death brings back nothing, you know. I have to stay alive, and carry them myself.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_009": "Is it snowing on that peak...? Ohh... Guess what, Doctor? I had a dream last night about sleeping in the chief's arms when I was first taken in. She stroked my forehead gently, and her palm was like the sun-scorched sand, warm and rough. They've never seen the snow. Now I see it for them.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_010": "It's a beautiful day out there. I had a good nap, and a good dream, for once.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_011": "I choose to stand here, and so the land beneath my feet is my home.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_012": "No need, I'll grab my weapon and shield and head to the training grounds.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_013": "It's a warrior's duty, no need to thank me... Wha? Blushing? Of course I'm not blushing. How could you even tell I'm blushing through my tan?",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_014": "Thanks, Doctor... I'll take this medal back to my homeland. The spring there has dried up, but it will continue to bless me, and they will know that I'm still fighting.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_017": "Love, friends, hearth. That's what a warrior lives for.",

        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_024": "I see them.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_025": "Victory or death!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_026": "We will defend our home!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_027": "The enemy will never see our backs!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_028": "Raise your weapons and shields! Not one step back!",

        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_030": "The invaders' swords cut their own throats. An end they deserve.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_031": "Haha, it is an honor to die defending my home.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_032": "My homeland, my friends, my love... they're all waiting for me.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_033": "The heck? No alcohol here...? Huh? What's that in my mug? It's just some b… umm... bubbly barley juice.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_034": "Hey! Hands off.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_036": "Hahaha! Oh, I hate being tickled…",

        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_038": "The strongest liquor for the bravest warrior. This one is mine, Doctor. If you really want it... devour this whole roasted game, and you'll be our hero for the day!",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_042": "Yo, Doctor, you sure you don't need to sun a bit?",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_043": "I made this drinking horn out of the sands of my tribal homeland. A new warrior blows her victory horn after her first battle, celebrating her arrival into the world.",
        "char_4023_rfalcn_CN_044": "It's hard to describe what I felt when I first saw Rhodes Island sail by in the distance, the rumbling of the ship and the tremor of the sands... it's like my chief was whispering in my ear: You've found another place worth fighting for.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_001": "Doctor, might these be the books and documents you were looking for? No, no need to thank me, I'm simply glad to be of help. How would I have known what you needed? Heheh. That would be... secret.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_002": "Phantom and I certainly have... our similarities, in what we've been through. Though now he pursues the truth, I only wish to be far removed from it.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_003": "Doctor. About that lady who came to borrow your books... was her name Mint? She seems to be curious about a great many things. Curiosity in excess usually invites disaster, you see, and I have my reservations.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_004": "It is quite the relief you were with us last mission, Doctor. I find myself dazed by the sight of you when you command. As if something crosses past the curtain of night and the stirring stars, leading your way...",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_005": "Dance, music. Both soothe the soul, twin arts calling on us to focus and follow. But at times, too great a fixation can be our undoing. Such stories were already far too plenty where I formerly lived. Even I... am no exception to the rule.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_006": "Doctor? What are you standing there for...? I see... you overheard me talking with someone...? Cease with the jests, please. There is no one here... but me.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_007": "You wish to learn of the Crimson Troupe's affairs? Of course, I know of them all. But take caution, Doctor, for should you stray like they from the proper path... or come near to too many of them, you may be taken hold of. And that is not, whatsoever, desirable.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_008": "Here you are once more. Please, sit. Be reassured that I will not drive you out. So, what's the matter this time? Could Hibiscus have made another healthy meal? Or is Sideroca bound to whisk you away for training again?",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_009": "My stories are hackneyed, bereft of novelty. Likely, not as engaging as you imagine. You would like to hear them nonetheless? Very well. Then I will tell you tales... but in exchange, Doctor, would you grant me a request?",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_010": "Doctor. Doctor? Beg pardon, I know I should not disturb your rest... but it is far too still here for me to fully be at ease.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_011": "I envisaged the scene in which we would formally meet, Doctor, and this very moment brings it to life. Operator Shalem, pleased to make your acquaintance.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_012": "At times, I do feel the battlefield and the stage resemble one another, in ways.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_013": "Promotion, did you say...? Ah, I'm sorry, it just startled me. Thank you for your acknowledgement, Doctor.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_014": "Unlike him, still wreathed in his struggle, I had long since fled the past, never to concern me again... yes, Doctor, so I once hoped.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_017": "Worry not, coordinating with others is a strength of mine. So long as nothing untoward happens...",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_018": "I may lack for power, but I will do all that I can.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_019": "Everyone, follow me, please.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_020": "See those on the stage... knowing nothing of their fates.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_021": "Fret not.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_022": "Their future is clear to see.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_023": "I hope we may resolve this peacefully.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_024": "To kill and to be killed, to do battle. Far too many plays are penned on these themes.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_025": "And may this end as swiftly as can be.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_026": "The path you all now walk bears not one hope.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_027": "Surely, your skulls... would be mesmerizing to see, right?",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_028": "Hahahaha... haha, hahahahahahaha...",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_029": "This is far beyond my wildest dreams. The best outcome, Doctor.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_030": "It is done. Be at ease, for no danger remains. Well done, Doctor.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_031": "Our mission is complete, Doctor. As for those who escaped... they have their own fates to meet.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_032": "Haste not; ponder leisurely. We still have opportunities.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_033": "Shall we rest here a while? How about some music?",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_034": "Ah... I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_036": "Doctor, could you hold my coat for me briefly? I'll be done in a moment. My thanks.",

        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_038": "Some dance and song is all it takes—days like these never fail to tempt art into showing a hint of its beauty, such that more would bow to it. A grand performance is about to begin, Doctor, and when the time has come, will you be able to recognize the true me beneath the limelight?",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_042": "Welcome, Doctor. Indeed, I knew you would surely come.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_043": "Excellent, you are here just as I expected. Though some young operators express their affection in far too ardent ways, you'll nevertheless break their hearts should you hide away like this. And one more hint before you open the door, try to place your feet back, and find something to brace against. Yes. This way, you won't be thrown to the floor when they joyfully tackle you.",
        "char_4025_aprot2_CN_044": "I have to wear this...? Are you sure, Doctor? I don't recall this sort of adornment being called for on the stage... Very well... And dance with you? That would be a little... Oh my. Excuse me, Doctor. The steps here should go like this... Here, let me show you.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_001": "Have someone else handle the paperwork and filing. But if you need anyone dealt with, or protected, just give me the list of names. I'll take care of them.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_002": "These are clothes and snacks for Lisa, along with gifts for her friends. As for this box of old books her papa insisted I bring, I'm not sure what they're for. I'll just let Lisa decide what to do with them.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_003": "Uniform? No, thanks. I don't know why you people need so many pockets. Just as I can't grasp why the Higashinese stuff planks and pillows in their waistbands, making it so terribly hard to move around… Anyway, I'm fine with this outfit, and it has nothing to do with me being Siracusan.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_004": "Some of the operators here have unsteady breathing. Perhaps they could try reciting a tanka or two to adjust their breaths as they strike, like: 'Solitude seeps not from autumn shade, but from the mountain pines in red sun's fall.' Or 'I bear no off'ring branch unto the hills, for rich brocades of maple sate the gods.' You think these lines evoke a particular image? Hm. Probably.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_005": "No need to hide the Wolumonde story from me. Hm, you look nervous, but I'm not here to cast blame, my daughter knows the meaning of her work. <i>Suzuran</i> is no fragile flower, and I am no hidebound gardener.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_006": "My return trip to Siracusa? The perpetrator is dead, so there is little else to say. The man who, in his lust for power, deprived so many of a decent life, did not deserve a decent death.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_007": "Lost in thought? Is something wrong? Hm, some business less suited to a so-called <i>pharmaceutical company</i>, is it? If you need my help, do speak clearly now. You see, Doctor, I have only the patience to manage this single braid.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_008": "The wine tasting is already finished? I went to freshen up and hurried back as quickly as I could... Ah, sorry, but my work demands it. You see, precision is everything. I must be meticulous about which bastard die at which moment, not a second sooner. Hehe, but we don't need to pick a time for whiskey. Care to stay a while longer?",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_009": "So much snow on the deck, and yet the corridors are not cold. I detest inconsistent weather, so the landship has been a blessing. I only just realized how long I've been here. You're right, an assassin's vacation is a good thing, for herself, and others.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_010": "I'll stay here, just call me if you need something. Hard to believe? Sometimes, I can be very patient, Doctor. Have you ever tried combing nineteen tails in one go?",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_011": "Hello. You must be 'the incredible Doctor' Lisa always mentions in her letters. Hmm, I've been curious to know what you looked like, and here you are. Which reminds me, could you update me on Lisa's studies, if you have the time?",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_012": "It's not often I see recordings of myself. I fought my battles in quiet alleyways, with no witnesses.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_013": "I appreciate the recognition. But this means those after the bounty on my head will come looking for Rhodes Island. You are not worried?",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_014": "I accept your medal, Doctor. You needn't say more. I do know the difference between this medal, and the emblems of the Siracusan family.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_017": "Leave the toughest one for me.",
        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_018": "Just keep yourselves safe, ladies and gentlemen.",

        "char_4026_vulpis_CN_029": "Higashinese shoji screens often run a common theme. The kami created life and land to propagate themselves… A pity they didn't care for what came after. Sorting out this mess is hard work.",

I don't understand why you people need so many pockets, just as I can't grasp why the Higashinese love stuffing planks and pillows into their waists, making it so terribly hard to move around...

But considering Rhodes Island's revenue, I suppose the pay isn't completely unreasonable—Speaking of which, what do you think of my plan to demand compensation from companies we've worked with? What? How can it be extortion when we're asking for pocket change?!",
        "char_4032_provs_CN_008": "Doctor, I think there are a lot of problems with the medical malpractice liability clauses in Rhodes Island's contracts. In most countries, we as a medical company wouldn't be liable for a lot of the scenarios listed in there—You don't want to fix it? Alright, I'll give it some more thought.",

        "char_4052_surfer_CN_009": "Doctor, would you sit with me for a moment? I've always understood that my duty is to scout ahead and blaze a trail. Still, despite my meticulous planning, there are times when most of my people don't come back. It seems, no matter how hard I try, it's never quite enough.",
        "char_4052_surfer_CN_010": "Don't you feel cooped up staying indoors, Doctor, especially when you finally got some free time? How 'bout we go for a walk…? The sunlight out there is just perfect.",

        "char_4052_surfer_CN_014": "Guess what, Doctor? Yesterday, on my way back here, I saw a brilliant red sunset. A good omen that today would be a lucky day. Sooo, have you come bearing good news?",
        "char_4052_surfer_CN_017": "Adding me to this wilderness mission was a wise choice. Trust me, Doctor, I'll ensure your safe return to the landship.",

        "char_4052_surfer_CN_044": "Sometimes, the farther the destination, the fewer provisions I load. In the wilderness, packing too much means a heavy burden; a light pack is the key to success. I've carried a lot for a long time: as the weight on your shoulders grows heavier, and the road ahead remains infinitely long, how will you ultimately reach the end, Doctor?",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_001": "You want me to do file collation work...? These documents of yours all look dusty. I don't want to touch them. And how was your office even planned in the first place? Did you genuinely not feel personally, utterly disgusted leaving this cabinet here?",

Because when all's said and done, it's not you or me that'll be left behind. It's this landship's skeleton. That's what's going to endure. That's what will stand for us.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_003": "You've got some planning work for me? I'll ask to review my partners' design styles first. As long as they aren't too complex about it, I might be able to accept—okay, okay, fine, I'll do it, I'll take it, it's not as if collaborations are some big deal. Besides, it's not that you have disastrous taste.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_004": "What is it... Ah, darn it, the pencil smudged my belt again. I just got it replaced... Last time it was Gavial, saying she'd get me a new one of the same look. As if! The emblem on the clasp was straight from my designs, and obviously she didn't even give those an honest look!",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_005": "I know, I'll go to the infirmary in a bit. I don't want to interrupt my thought process at the moment. And you know, Doctor, the moment is the exact thing I most value—you called Gavial in? Was she on duty at the Medical Department today? You can't fool—hello, Gavial, no no, I wasn't just working on any designs.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_006": "I used to appreicate a fan base of one, one who can truly see to the core of my designs, rather than having a crowd of followers with their superfacial admiration. For me, the latter holds absolutely no significance. But now… I suppose it's not all bad to let the masses see them. Discussion swirling around my work means I'm still alive.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_007": "Why do I tend not to greet anyone? Because once I do, I have to make small talk, and that forces me to crane my head up to speak with them, which makes me seem insignificant. We should be seeing eye-to-eye, on EQUAL footing... Are you asking if it weighs on me? As if! It just makes my neck ache.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_008": "I was genuinely full of anxiety back then. I always felt I didn't have enough time, though I'd never even accomplished a thing. But nowadays, I've gotten to the point where I can appreciate my own designs. The only thing is, it's been years since I last saw my teacher. I wonder if he'd be proud of me?",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_009": "A close look is all it takes to unearth the core sense of a man from his work. Just like how I used to disdain anything superfluous. I treated my own life in the same way. Doctor, an artwork is a microcosm of its creator's life. Yours, I can understand.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_010": "Hmm. Such a counter-conventional sleeping posture, such a complex yet stable load-bearing structure... miraculous. Is this not going to give you neck arthritis?",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_011": "I'm Operator Minimalist, freshly dragged here by Gavial. So this is what a nomadic landship's like? You must have a much easier time avoiding Catastrophes than we do underground. Hmph, the only thing in those fools' heads is merrily drinking their lives away—ow, Gavial, what did you hit me for?!",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_012": "...If it's not architecture-related, I don't want to see it.",

        "char_4054_malist_CN_014": "Everyone's experiences are different, and the significance lying behind my works will be out of sight to most... but there are some, like you, like my mentor, that I hope can understand.",

        "char_4054_malist_CN_030": "*cough* *cough* *cough*... There's so much dust—it's filthy. Gah.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_031": "What are you looking at me for? You want me to chase them?",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_032": "Snap out of it! Get running!",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_033": "I don't want to open my eyes . I'm worried the interior design is going to scare the life out of me.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_034": "Hold on, I'm busy.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_036": "Phew... what time is it? No, what day of the week? Er... did I eat anything yet? I don't think I did...?",

        "char_4054_malist_CN_038": "Ah, this is the calendar you keep on the surface. I've heard of it. The significance in a holiday like this to commemorate a year's end—it's such an improvement over those days of pure idle indulgence... So another year's already passed. Be sure to cherish your time well, Doctor.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_042": "Doctor, sitting for too long can leave you prone to neck arthritis. I suggest you watch out for yourself.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_043": "I've been straining my wrist muscles over the past few days. The Medic Operators told me it'd improve a little using these wrist braces, so I bought a few spares. I was at a loss for what to give you today, so take these two as a present. Just fix them to the table and they'll work.",
        "char_4054_malist_CN_044": "My life is doomed to be as short as it is. How could I ever reconcile with that? I find it genuinely difficult to keep calm... not that you—need to console me. If I was truly that weak, then I wouldn't be standing here right now.",

        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_002": "I recall my first time ordering a fountain pen from Zeruertza's artisans, where I didn't make my requirements clear. Then I ended up with this crossbow. It plagues me to have had the peace-loving Durin forges a weapon… Operator Myrtle? Calling herself Generalissimo? That's just a childish fan—Ahem, it's her own self-styling.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_003": "If you'll permit my frankness, it's my belief Rhodes Island should build work and living environments more suited to the Durin operators. At least the cafeteria menu should be decided by vote—they're all satisfied? They can't be! I'll go and ask them, lest you—lest someone be tricking them.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_004": "You require me to draft some slogans? I'd be happy to. It was routine work of mine in Zeruertza. You only need to provide me a typewriter, and that's all... Why do I not use a pen? My fountain pen is typically for more private things, more... not-so-Durin things.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_005": "I was a steadfast teetotaler back in Ursus, but to my surprise, I could keep more drink down than most in Zeruertza. Truth be told, I didn't immediately understand why they loved their drink so, but I did eventually come to realize. We only drink in excess when hope is lost, and a forever stagnant, easy life can lose us hope as well as anything.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_006": "I still hold that life in the Durin cities far surpasses that of the surface, but I have to admit, the flowerets that vie to bloom in the ruins have more of a power than all the blossoms of Durin greenhouses... Hah. All these years, and yet I'm a surface-dweller through and through.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_007": "Ursus desserts and wine? Let someone else have the pastries, please. 'Ursus-style' is an exceptional stranger to me by now. That said, do leave the liquor here. Zeruertzans love their drink, and I'm no exception—wait, this isn't mead. Is this pure spirits? Oh, my head...",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_008": "Noble? Correct, I was once a noble. Until a conspiracy wrested my family away, and left me with the sole luck of escaping underground to Zeruertza. There was no avaricious nobility in the city, nor any commoners who'd take advantage for their own gain. Only kindhearted Durins... What more could I ask for?",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_009": "Doctor, I'd like to talk with you of beauty and virtue, of those things I consider vanished from the surface. I've witnessed their existence aboard Rhodes Island, and you've told me that more of their sparks are alight upon this land still... I don't dare trust. I have to go and see it for myself.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_010": "Doctor, are you asleep? No? Well, no matter. If you're planning to hold the same posture for a while, perhaps I might draw a fountain pen sketch of you.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_011": "I believe you're the Doctor? It's nice to meet you. Please accept my gratitude; thank you for allowing me to lodge here, a refuge on the unseemly surface.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_012": "I could never imagine. Do you show these violent, bloody tapes to the Durins as well?",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_013": "Thank you for the gesture of confidence. I'll endure the urge to flee the award ceremony as best I can, so please, if you could wrap it up soon... There's no ceremony, it's just a normal presentation? Oh, that's a relief.",
        "char_4055_bgsnow_CN_014": "Another promotion, is it? Thank you. I'll accept this honor with my chest out in pride... And of course, we don't need to end this presentation as quickly as last time. Do not be afraid of those I should not fear—this is what life aboard Rhodes Island has taught me.",

Mine's just a little more obvious than others.",

Unfortunately, most are as a great river surging forth, sweeping up all the sand and silt in its path until it turns into an unstoppable murky mess.

I know a scribe who served as the Grandmaster's record keeper. He followed the Grandmaster for over a decade. After years of observation, he could nitpick nearly any kung fu style under Heaven. And yet, he is weak to this day. A stiff breeze could blow him over... Anyway, I do happen to have some spare time. So I'll show you all a few moves.",

The hatred, I paid back how I saw fit; the gratitude, I will hold as close. That is all.",

In short, I've become the 'one without roots.' But, being rootless is not all bad, as it's led me here to you and Rhodes Island. There will always be a place where my sword comes in handy.

This bowl of chang shou mian is a recipe from my hometown, just drizzle them with some scallion oil, and add some stir-fry... simple to make, but lingers on the tongue. Did you like it? I'm glad. Here's to your good health for another year.",

Make no mistake, I'm not suggesting you were a good person or some kind of bastard. People always expect things to 'return to the way they were,' whether it's about circumstances or people.

        "char_4106_bryota_CN_002": "Doctor, I got the ceiling light fixed. Is it bright enough for you? If you don't need me for anything else, I'll go take care of other stuff. You think all this work is hard on me? I get to make some money, meet new friends, and seize the life I want to live with my own two hands. There's nothing better than this.",
        "char_4106_bryota_CN_003": "Ugh, I hit the wrong note again. Come on, don't laugh at me. Not all Siestans are natural-born musicians. Besides, the kalimba is harder than it looks!

We can set up a parasol there, grab some ice-cold sodas, lounge on some beach chairs, and watch the clouds. When I was a kid, I used to take naps after I was done helping out at the store. Fell asleep listening to the waves like this.",

I told my boss I forsook my assigned target for this bit of shrubbery, and he thinks I'm having him on somehow... But listen. I discovered this 'un. I gave it its name. And nothing could matter more than that.",

Doctor, remember not to tell anyone.",
        "char_4107_vrdant_CN_008": "You're right, I am in fact used to keeping a cold, stoic persona in front of strangers. After all, your average plant hunter doesn't usually get into interpersonal conflict with a standing army. It's more often absent-minded guards with fixed salaries. Overpowering your opposition by putting on airs can actually ensure your safety, funny enough.",

Back in my quiet little hometown, families would all give their scarecrows a fresh bit of kit at the start of each year... Not sure what the cultural significance of that was, but the most important thing is, don't let the fowlbeasts get too used to seeing the same getup. Fowls, they're smart little buggers.",

        "char_4136_phonor_CN_003": "The lace veil on the table? It was a gift that my sisters knitted for me the first time I returned to the Convallis. It is embroidered with a blessed incantation, capable of greatly amplifying the potency of Arts on the battlefield, and serving as a dust cover in times of peace.",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_004": "Doctor, my predecessor was an Arts device carrying a protective incantation. It was Aefanyl who chose to give me a consciousness, to bring me with him. So, in my algorithmic model, the very first line of code professes the Banshees' love for him. I think I'm very lucky. I was born to carry love.",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_007": "Sorry, Doctor, I'm the one who drew you here with my singing. Are you busy today? You were nowhere to be found— and please look over this document. It requires your urgent attention. Oh, right, this piping-hot cup of herbal tea is for you as well.",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_008": "Shhh, please don't tell Aefanyl that I hid his access card. I'm testing some data provided by my sisters: according to the calculations, the probability of Aefanyl's left eyebrow twitching when he gets angry is as high as 97.6%. Shall we observe this experiment together, Doctor?",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_009": "Doctor, as a Banshee, I know well the power of language per se. The most maleficent curse can't rival cold words hurled in the flesh. The most efficacious blessing dims beside compliments offered in person. As such, every word I speak to you has been carefully calculated thousands of times.",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_010": "Statistics show that not all Banshees prefer falling asleep in the embrace of melody. Most of my sisters actually favor 'Three Thousand Long Years: The Evolution of the Bone Flute' for sleep-inducing. I'd be glad to read you a passage, if you needed.",

        "char_4136_phonor_CN_034": "Doctor, an incantation has been laid upon me— one that brings bad luck to all those who touch me without permission. Oh, don't worry though, I've already given you my permission.",
        "char_4136_phonor_CN_036": "Doctor, I want to hear your opinion on something. The landship's choir asked me to be their soprano...",

        "char_4136_phonor_CN_044": "Throughout the long history of the Sarkaz, the Banshees suffered terrible losses after each upheaval. Our decision to go into isolation was a last resort. We were worried, of course, seeing Aefanyl stride into the heart of danger again and again with Rhodes Island, but we are also proud of him. He truly lives up to his Banshee name.",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_001": "I'm sorry, but the pen scratching you hear is just me engaging in <i>shorthanding...</i> to put it another way, I'm helping myself to think. I'm busy with Joint Marine Corps affairs, so I'm afraid I can't help you tackle your paperwork.",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_002": "It's been difficult explaining how my launcher works to the Sankta operators, and when I asked them about their guns, their eccentric answers only confused me more. Hm? I shouldn't lose heart? You're overthinking it, how could I be discouraged from just that? The reason I'm here is precisely for the sea and land to understand each other.",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_003": "Coffee, tea, cocoa... These land stimulants have a novel taste to them. They're not very effective, but it's fine. This way I get to try many types of them. How many cups have I had today? This is number eight. The Seaborn swarm is still on the move, and HQ may reach out at any time, so I have to stay alert.",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_004": "Doctor, there's no fresh information from Ægir on this sketch board. These wavy lines and small squares are just my thought process. As for what they mean exactly, it's very hard to explain. Hm? If this part means 'signal strength'? You... can read it?",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_005": "Unfortunately, I didn't manage to become an Abyssal Hunter, but that's not the only way Ægir fights the Seaborn. We have the Hunters, the Waterway—and many more in the future. My current position dictates I no longer be affiliated with any projects, but that does not imply my duties are lighter, even in the slightest.",

As long as you're not the one he's contacting—no, even if it <i>is</i> you— Nah, forget it, I've already neglected my duties by not reporting him immediately, not to mention our current situation. Anyway, I'd like you to tell him this for me—he may be a genius, but he is a terrible mess as a teacher.",
        "char_4137_udflow_CN_009": "The Abyssal Hunters have returned, surprisingly, and the Waterway has been opened somehow. Those are certainly not what I expected as watchman, but they are gratifying enough. Doctor, I stand here now watching over you as well, and look forward to seeing how you'll transform this war.",

        "char_4137_udflow_CN_044": "I had lots of worries before I came ashore. My concerns have been validated, yet I feel even more confident. Why? Because I see a universal tenacity shared by land and sea. You face Catastrophes as Ægir fights the Seaborn—we will never surrender.",
        "char_4138_narant_CN_001": "Alright, I'll schedule the training, organize a tournament, and manage the burdenbeasts. You handle all the talking and writing here. I got it wrong? But I thought I gave you the easiest tasks?",

Why are you backing away? It's not like I'm going to wipe the blood on your clothes. This is just from the Leporibeasts I slaughtered on the deck. Come tonight, and I'll treat you all to a nice meal.",

It's true that I couldn't pick the laboratory's lock, so when I saw the door open during the day, I pasted a 'Do not lock the door' notice inside. Wait... that face of yours... You knew it already? But I was so careful...",

Ship all the wood downstream before a flood hits. Plus, I know no one will transport any ancient paintings during a heatwave. But prayer vessels can be seen all over the ground in a long dry spell. Now I follow you chasing Catastrophes. As for the future, I might gather up a gang and go after the sun.",

The other, with its shorter wings, dwells in the woods, catching only glimpses of the blue sky through the leaves as it enjoys the shade. Which one am I? Hm... In truth, I don't wish to be a fowlbeast at all. I would rather be a tree that doesn't block the sky.",

        "char_4143_sensi_CN_003": "AH-CHOO! I was going to see inside the greenhouse where they raise the metal crabs, and fancy Marcille and Perfumer having a talk in there! I thought I'd slip out, but Marcille dragged me right back in to spray all these fancy smells on my beard. Now I can't even whiff an onion! AH-CHOO!",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_004": "Is this your kitchen? This is... unmistakably magic! Originium cookers, full-automatic ovens, an eight-burner range with temperature control—Aye, they're all for lazy people who lack of dedication to cooking. Take them away at once!",

There's a difference between convenience and laziness, aye?",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_006": "Just cleaned your kitchen, gave the crops a sprinkling, and put everything I cleaned out into the composter. I eat the food your grow here, and I put my effort back into this land. Makes me feel like I'm a part of it that way. Couldn't be more satisfied.",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_007": "The first time I went to that 'gym' place, they said they never saw a Durin as strong as me, and asked me how I got that way. I told them I just cook everyday. What's that? Now they're all in the kitchen tossing up stir-frys? Well, I'm pleased as punch to get so many people interested in cooking.",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_008": "Makes me happy to see Laios's bunch eating proper everyday now. That said, Doctor, I hear that you've been eating nothing but instant food lately, using your busy schedule as an excuse, and that's no way to stay healthy! You want balanced nutrition, and that'll only start with more fresh veggies and good-quality proteins!",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_009": "I might scratch my head at the things you all do everyday, but I respect you mightily for all the patients you'll take on. It warms the cockles of my heart too to see them enjoy my food so much. If we find any way to hop between here and the dungeon, I'll be coming back to visit you all.",

        "char_4143_sensi_CN_042": "Just in time, it's done. Come give my work a taste.",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_043": "Tell me anything you'd like to eat, no matter what. Go on now, it's your birthday, and I haven't much I could wrap up and give you anyhow, so I'll make you a whole banquet to celebrate!",
        "char_4143_sensi_CN_044": "This whole journey's been one endless surprise... Laios and Marcille are both much tougher than I'd thought, Chilchuck's really acting like a grown-up now, and I've made plenty of exciting new friends. It's been a fulfilling time, this.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_001": "Uh-huh... I see. Hand me this paperwork. I'll sort it out. What? Don't tell me 'I know you can do this'. I'm not a child!",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_002": "Tch... I had a feeling, but actually hearing the doc dissect my numbers during the checkup was another thing. I need a while away from any missions with Senshi and Laios. Can't keep eating with them at this rate.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_003": "I see your face, and I know what you're thinking—'I didn't even know you could eat this!' or something like that. I was reluctant at first, but then I got used to it. Spend enough time with them, and you will too. Uh, not that getting used to it matters or anything, I mean.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_004": "*sigh* This is what I get for hanging around Laios and Senshi. Now everyone thinks I'm some monster-loving wacko too. What's that you've got there, Doctor? Senshi's brand new pièce de résistance? ...You look excited, too. Don't tell me you're one of them?",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_005": "Okay. It's dawned on me that Durins look young because they're actually young—Myrtle more than anyone. That girl is practically a child. I had a brief conversation with her, and she decided I was lying about not being her age—give me a break!",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_006": "Doctor, Terran mimics are much easier to tell than the dungeon kind. Watch, all it takes to lure one is some bait, just wait for it to bite and you can—ha! Nailed it... Tch, didn't expect there's another one!",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_007": "I used to manage a guild too, you know. It keeps me on my feet every day, but sometimes even my own kind don't see the point. With Rhodes Island being such a big organization, you should learn to unwind every now and then. Wanna go grab a drink? It's not like the work will run off while you're away, so we may as well relax for now.",

        "char_4144_chilc_CN_009": "You want to try dungeoneering? Considering the combat skills you have, you can never have too many extra lives. Okay, how about this? If you really wanna go, then you must follow <i>my</i> instructions when it comes to pathfinding and operation strategies. I'm the expert. For anything else, you and Laios can make it up.",

        "char_4144_chilc_CN_011": "I've read through the contract. The terms all look solid, and so do the benefits. If you can pay me upfront, I'll be glad to work with you. I'm being blunt here for good reason—it benefits us all that we hash this out in advance, doesn't it?",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_012": "You're not gonna try and put me in combat, are you?",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_013": "Thanks. I'll do however much I'm paid for.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_014": "The viciousness of Terra gives dungeons a real run for their money. On top of that, you have some nasty mimics too... Doctor, you ever see a suspicious chest, don't sit on it. Let me deal with it. Understand?",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_017": "Let's be clear, I'm just the scout. Don't count on me for combat.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_018": "This isn't my forte, but I'll try.",

        "char_4144_chilc_CN_024": "Doctor, this is a mistake, right?!",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_025": "You asked for it!",

        "char_4144_chilc_CN_030": "Good wrap-up, and I'm a little hungry too. Times like this call for... tch, they're tainting me.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_031": "You guys recover for now, I'll keep watch. Don't worry, if anyone approaches, I'll hear.",

        "char_4144_chilc_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_038": "A party? Count me out. Some Durin buddies got hold of some good booze, I'll go meet with them and we're getting ourselves smashed. If you want a round yourself, you're free to come by. Oh yeah, and Happy New Year.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_042": "Doctor, you're not here just to see me, are you?",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_043": "Catch—yep, that's a lockpicking kit, your birthday present. You were curious ever since Senshi brought it up, right? I got Engineering to make you a whole set. Do whatever you like with it, just don't let me know.",
        "char_4144_chilc_CN_044": "To be honest, I was pretty skeptical of you at first. People who say they'll help for nothing are usually up to some pretty shocking stuff behind your back. Now? Now I believe a do-gooder <i>can</i> be real, I'll say that...",

I once reminded her that in the depths of the abyss, maintaining your sense of direction is both more difficult and more important than increasing your speed. Yes, of course my navigational skills are better than the other Hunters, ",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_003": "There's no point in staring at it. Ægir's musical notation would be unfamiliar to you land-dwellers. I make it a habit to compose a song before battle, and I ask my teammates to memorize it. Once the battle is over, they are to sing it with utmost accuracy. The Seaborn have no taste for artistry, so it has proved a useful test.",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_004": "Sargonian, Iberian, Rim Billitonian... During my short time on the land, I have learned several languages. The Seaborn are willing to communicate with other kinds for the sake of their evolution, while humanity uses whatever excuses it can to divide itself. We should be ashamed of ourselves.",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_005": "There are many ways to foster unity. Perhaps you could blame your collapse on a common foe, or open up a waterway that changes the tide of war, or maybe send a disgraced, fallen man into exile... Hmm. This really is the only value I can bring to the table.",

I should be off now. Stay in contact... Become one of them, then uncover their fatal weakness from within... this is the only way.",

        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_008": "You are very forward-thinking with your vision of the future of gene therapy, but right now, discussing anything other than the Seaborn or the Hunters is a waste of our time. Doctor, they continue their endless march onto dry land, but the answer lies deep in the abyss.",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_009": "The Hunters will lose awareness if deprived of water, but they need only return to the sea to awake their past. How about you? What opportunity would you need? What did you forget, and why did you forget it? You have been to the depths of the abyssal sea, you are connected to all this. I need you to recall, Doctor.",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_010": "You are dreaming. Which part of yourself do you speak to?",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_011": "We meet again. This method of contact that you are imposing upon me, is it Rhodes Island's standard treatment, or perhaps it is you trying to confirm if my sense of self has already begun to change… Hmph. Ulpianus, Abyssal Hunter.",
        "char_4145_ulpia_CN_012": "You must think carefully on what you base your battle plans upon.",

What did I do, you ask? Hmmm... finding their lost pets, organizing their thoughts, and other stuff like that. Nothing special.",
        "char_4146_nymph_CN_006": "Hi Doctor, just wanted to check if you're satisfied with my work so far? Cos you know, being trusted and being favored are two different things. We Djaj get the latter a lot, but the former... Mm, I can hear it. Thank you for your trust, Doctor.",

Go to the cafeteria, and have a big, hearty meal. No coming back after dinner either. Okay? That's right. Everyone deserves a break on their birthdays, even the hardest worker. Now come on, let's go.",
        "char_4146_nymph_CN_044": "Looking back, it's amazing how much I've done this year. I've been going back and forth between Rhodes Island and Kazdel so much, it's a wonder my legs didn't fall off... Tired? Umm, not really. More like happy. As for next year... Hmm... I think it's best not to think about it too much. It's the unknown that fills us up with anticipation, right?",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_001": "Whaa? More work? But I came to Rhodes Island for a good holiday... Alright, if it's simply sorting files, I'm OK with that, I guess. But tell me, Doctor, what's my per diem?",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_002": "The report you wanted's on your desk. Yeah, just one page. Not like we get something new in Kazdel every day. I mean C'mon, What else do you wanna know? How to pick the gate of the Temple of Knowledge? Cut me some slack, will ya? I'm just a slum snitch. Oh, right, you people here prefer <i>intelligence agent.</i>",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_003": "Our rules are different from the ones you have at Rhodes Island. Also, they're not spelled out in black and white. Cuz' paper's pricey, and only a few can read.

        "char_4147_mitm_CN_004": "The bandages on my digits? Just for style. Funny story, a few days ago I taught a bunch of nitpicking punks a lesson at the market. A vendor saw these bandages and thought I got hurt in the scuffle, so he gave me a few more green onions as a thank-you gift. Hmm? There's blood seeping out? No worries, that's just beetroot juice.",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_005": "We call brown bread 'soft brick' and coats 'plaster'… What about sausages? What about 'em? Just sausages. Why? I mean, why give something you only get to eat once every few years a moniker? There's not much to the Kazdelian street slang, really. Just hang around a local construction site and you'll learn everything you need to know.",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_006": "With how crowded Rhodes Island is, I'm surprised you don't have full-on fights on your hands. In Kazdel, people trade blows over just about anything, like if a valve should be turned once or twice. Sounds stupid, right? But when I tried to calm them down, I had to defuse a fight with dozens of pitchforks and shovels in my face. By the time I did, my legs were so wobbly I could barely walk home.",

Tell you what, I also have a 50% off coupon for two, so if you don't tell Closure my plan, I'll take you for some roast beast tonight.",
        "char_4147_mitm_CN_009": "Seems like there's more budget for next season's operation? I'm not a real intelligence dealer, but I agree with one of their rules: Valuable info for valuable clients.

        "char_4147_mitm_CN_044": "Doctor, I've archived these reports as you requested. I even have a closing speech for you while you wipe my access clearances.

I thought, since it would be my final companion anyway, I might as well use it to ward off evil.",

        "char_430_fartth_CN_032": "Go on ahead...! I'll hold them here, Doctor! Lead the others away!",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_033": "Not bad. The airflow here feels refreshing... Thank you.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_034": "Hm? What is it? Want an autograph?",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_036": "Doctor...? Yeah, I can tell it's you without listening to your footsteps. The winds around you aren't like the others.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_038": "There are so many noises mixed in on the wind here. Fireworks, dishes and glasses, the voices of people as they celebrate. My neighbors would be just as noisy every holiday back home, but I've never minded it, because that's how this day should be. Happy New Year, Doctor.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_042": "Don't move... Your hair's sticking out. That's right. Stay still. I'll fix it for you.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_043": "Here, Doctor. This is your present from me. It's a chime. Hang it on your window, and it'll sing whenever the breeze stirs. Very soothing. Happy birthday, Doctor. I gift you the sound of the wind.",
        "char_430_fartth_CN_044": "I brought this flute from home, and the only songs I play are ones my neighbors taught me. I know you can never return to the past, but that's not so bad, is it? Just like how the wind never blows back to where it came from. It carries itself on its own momentum, flying further and further away, to a loftier place.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_001": "So, just like the big corporations' office workers, even you have a bunch of deskwork to do. That's quite a lot, too. Do you need any help?",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_002": "I never imagined the Radiant Knight would take up employment anywhere. Rhodes Island is a mysterious company.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_003": "Knights may be able to climb back up after they fall, but the Infected don't have such kindhearted options available to them.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_004": "*Cough*... My weapon seems to be acting up, *cough*... Which way is the workshop? That way? Thank you. *Cough*.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_005": "If the knight nobles were able to fulfill their vows and responsibilities, the Infected wouldn't have found themselves so oppressed. But... those nobles... the Kazimierz people would rather sign contracts with those big security companies than trust those knight nobles to protect them from crime and violence.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_006": "They tell me my family met its downfall because I got infected, that I am to blame for everything. Hmph, just what you'd expect from the knight nobles. They're all good-for-nothings who know only to bully the weak.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_007": "Justyna likes to use titles when she talks to me... Why is that? Is the word 'Ashlock' that special to her?",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_008": "Sona and I met each other during a team melee match. That was a tough battle, but we reached an understanding and worked with each other as soon as we met. At the very end, she took all my points with her sword, but then apologized to me right away... That's how we started working together.",
        "char_431_ashlok_CN_009": "If I can't go back home anymore, then all I can do is find the way forward with Sona and the gang. Heh... Becoming an Infected knight hasn't been kind to me, but at least we have the chance to fight.

        "char_436_whispr_CN_044": "Please, allow me to sit out here on my own. It doesn't feel quite right being a part of this ship's commemoration day, given that I don't know when I might depart... That being said, I will always remember the sound of rain pattering on the deck. There's little else like it.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_001": "Dr. Kal'tsit told me if you ever chose to place me at your side, it means you've decided to protect me. But maybe you're just as clueless as I am with her riddle, Doctor. Still, I'm sure she must've said it for a reason.",

        "char_437_mizuki_CN_004": "Oh, this? It's a classic arcade game that used to be popular in Higashi. Want to have a go, Doctor? Here, just move that yellow mouth to eat and grow. However… until you've absorbed enough nutrients to grow strong, you'll only be prey to others.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_005": "A sense of justice? No, You got me wrong, Doctor. I don't really care much about bad guys. It's just… for some reason, good people always let them get away with bad things. What if... someone came along and got rid of them? No one would feel bad for them, right? Everyone would just be happy.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_006": "Hmm… I still don't get your point, Doctor, but I just need to take out the ones you say are bad, yes? After all, I know the Doctor is a good person. What if you're the bad guy? Don't ask me that! I would be crushed. Even if you are, I really, really don't wanna…",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_007": "There's something on this ship that's both familiar and strange... gentle, yet hostile. It's making me uneasy, Doctor.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_008": "Doctor, what does it feel like to hold the lives of others in your hands? If it were me, their warmth would make me tremble with excitement. Hm? Oh, I was talking about you as a commander, holding everyone's lifeline.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_009": "The food and nutrients we take in sustain and shape us. So sometimes I wonder... if we ate the same food and did the same things, would we gradually become the same? Doctor, would we?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_010": "It's time to take a little break, Doctor. Come here, lie down. I'll go grab a blanket.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_011": "Ah, hello there, Doctor. Dr. Kal'tsit tells me you're my commander from today on! It's too bad I don't count as an official operator, but as long as you need my help, I'll do whatever I can.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_012": "I need to digest and absorb all this, right? I'll do my best.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_013": "I've earned your approval? Does that mean I can go to more places with you and get rid of more bad guys?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_014": "On one rainy day, I received an unexpected gift that changed me, but I was not taught how to face the future… Doctor, if it were you, would you have shown me the path yourself?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_017": "I should stay hidden, even from my teammates? Understood, I'll do as you say, Doctor.",

        "char_437_mizuki_CN_024": "Be bold, Doctor, trust what the mind says.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_025": "Looks like a piece of cake.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_026": "Thanks for the treat.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_027": "These tentacles are illusions? Why delude yourself?",

        "char_437_mizuki_CN_029": "What a tough nut to crack. It'll take some time to digest this battle.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_030": "There are fewer bad guys out there now, and it's all thanks to you, Doctor!",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_031": "Huh? Doctor, why'd you let some bad guys through? I'll go clean them up for you.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_032": "If it's only to cover everyone's retreat, I can do that… No, just saving everyone is not enough, the bad guys still need to be eliminated…",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_033": "Shall I whip up something tasty to help everyone unwind?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_034": "Hmm? What's up?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_036": "Achoo! Ugh... Why does it feel like someone's looking right through me...",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_038": "Happy New Year, Doctor! We've all grown by another year, and I've absorbed plenty of nutrients. I really hope everyone can keep evolving and become even better.",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_042": "Did you miss me, Doctor?",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_043": "I dunno where it came from… But they say if you mix a little of yourself into a cake, then whoever eats it will go crazy for you. Sounds… sick, right? Wait, Doctor, don't run away! I didn't put anything weird in this birthday cake, I swear!",
        "char_437_mizuki_CN_044": "Doctor, when you look at me now, what do you see? Am I still just a kid, or have I grown strong enough… maybe even stronger than you? If that were true… Then shouldn't I protect you instead?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_001": "Doctor? No, I wasn't taking a nap! I was... I was just spacing out!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_002": "Is it raining outside? I used to really hate rainy days... Mud gets everywhere, and construction grinds to a halt. Dad would always come home late when it rained. But I always felt cozy when the rain let up and I'd stay inside, just like this.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_003": "Back when I worked construction in Columbia, life was a real grind. I had to get up early every morning and go to bed late every night. Sometimes I'd be working overtime and suddenly realize I hadn't slept at all…",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_004": "Oh, Doctor, would you like to go for a walk together? Hm? Ahh...! Wh-Where's my tool bag...? Did I leave it at the construction site again? I-I'm sorry, wait a sec while I fetch it!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_005": "What I want to do...? Hmm... A steady job and an honest life would be enough for me. So why sign on to be an operator here? Well... The pay is a bit better, and the work isn't all that different... so I figured, why not give it a shot? I guess?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_006": "The Infected... There were plenty of Infected workers back in Columbia. Everyone warned me to keep my distance. But watching them work, I realized they're no different from the rest of us.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_007": "Oh... what the job Closure put me on again...? If I go back and ask her, I'll probably get an earful... Say, Doctor? Do you think you could help me out...?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_008": "My dad always says, studying hard is the key to a better life. Doctor, you know lots of stuff, right? Could you teach me something? I promise I won't zone out. Well, I'll try really hard, anyway.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_009": "I never used to think much about the future. I figured I'd just drift between odd jobs with the Pioneers, spending my life as a craftsman. But now... I really need to thank our friend—the big guy. I wouldn't have met you, if it wasn't for him... Uh... A-Anyway, I really appreciate what he did for me.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_010": "Fwahh... I'm so tired... Maybe I'll take a little nap, just like the Doctor...",

        "char_440_pinecn_CN_013": "Thank you, Doctor... But what should I do now? Oh... Do I just kinda do what the others do? Okey-dokey…",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_014": "Hm...? Another promotion? Ehehe, you're awfully forgetful yourself, Doctor. Didn't you already give me a promot—This is a new one? Um... Okay. I'll follow your lead. So, when are we heading out?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_017": "Time for work.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_018": "I guess it's like being a foreman at a construction site?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_019": "Um... Where are we going again...?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_020": "It's the enemy! Don't hold back!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_021": "Yes, I'm listening!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_022": "What's the job, Doctor!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_023": "Here, right?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_024": "I'll stay right here like a nail.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_025": "Hyah!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_026": "I still have lots of batteries on me!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_027": "Pulling the trigger!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_028": "Just like shooting nails at work!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_029": "Phew... That was a lot harder than building a house. Doctor, it makes us kinda impressive, don't you think?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_030": "That was perfect... Doctor, are you happy with how we did?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_031": "Hmm... Maybe I messed up the process...? I'm sorry. It didn't go as well as I'd hoped.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_032": "Eh? Why are there sparks... S-Sorry... It's all my fault...",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_033": "Okay, is there anything that needs maintenance?",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_034": "Ah...!",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_036": "Doctor, want to watch the rain together? There's not much to see, though...",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_038": "Uh, since it's New Year's, I figured I'd give your office a little touch-up, Doctor... Yes, I cleaned up some wear marks and remade the wall decorations. Err, if—if you don't like it, I can take everything down right away...",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_042": "Hello, Doctor.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_043": "Happy birthday, Doctor. Hope you have another year of steady employment as a doctor... Err, is that not your job? Okay, I hear you. So, uh... hope you have a year with less overtime. Mm-hm.",
        "char_440_pinecn_CN_044": "Doctor, after listening to everyone's stories over dinner, I've been wondering... I feel like we're doing something epic, aren't we? So, would it be... inappropriate someways if I brought my parents to work at Rhodes Island?",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_001": "Thirty-two, then thirty... three? Oh, Doctor? Wait, where was I? Hmm, I've been away half an hour? No worries, almost done. The fiftieth document from the left... one, two... don't worry, I'm the best counter at my escort association.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_002": "In this line of work, encountering odd clients comes with the territory. There was this one time when I was hired to escort a gentleman, he insisted I carry him on my back down a muddy road. I agreed, but said only after terminating our escort contract, because I couldn't defend him while carrying someone on my back.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_003": "Doctor, take some of these. My family came by during their escort job and brought me some treats from back home. What? We're under attack? Wait, you mean... them? Uh, hey, don't smoke on the landship. Put your shoes on and mind your manners! Don't glare at people like that! Ahem, Doctor... let me introduce you to my family.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_004": "I'll ask the local bandit boss about the situation here. No, we're not exactly friends, but we sort of pay this toll of theirs. Does that sound like we're in cahoots with the bandits? Hahah, it's just a way we can both make a living. Nobody wants unnecessary bloodshed, if we can help it.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_005": "I got the crystals on my hand from a highwayman. His legs were shaking and I thought I could talk him out of it, but his mind was made up. When I discarded his Originium explosive, we both got caught in the blast. In the end, I left him some money for his sick child's treatment. As for my own condition, I got used to it long ago.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_006": "Not every bandit manages to make the move to an honest escort life. Some have walked the way of the bandit for too long to change, many of them were aunts and uncles who watched me grow up. I couldn't look them in the eye when I had to show them out, but people must keep moving forward, right?",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_007": "What are you eating? Give me a bite; I haven't eaten yet. Ran into a righteous volunteer on the way, he was collecting relief funds for his hometown that got hit by a Catastrophe, so I gave him all my money. A scam? Maybe, but I don't need more money than I can spend, and I can always sock him if it turns out he was lying. It's not like I'll ever starve with you around.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_008": "My swords? This one was given by my adoptive mother. The other was hers—she threw it in my face the day she left. The blood was everywhere. I had tried to convince her to retire from banditry and join the escort business, but she saw it as a betrayal. People... when goals differ, they are quick to call it treachery. She raised me, after all.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_009": "Once I no longer have to worry about the escort association, I want to go wander the jianghu, to see what's out there. Want to come along, Doctor? Where to? Haven't thought about it yet. What matters is wandering free like a fowlbeast, traveling only with my two swords, drawing them at the first sign of injustice, and drinking and singing to my heart's delight.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_010": "Want some dried plums, Doctor? I always eat one when I get sleepy on the night shift. A piece of green plum with no sugar added works better than pinching my thigh. Haha, look at your face! You look like the plum just bit <i>you.</i>",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_011": "You're the Doctor of Rhodes Island? I've heard so much about you. I sign this, and you'll be an official friend of Windscoot. Any help you might need, just— er... no, I know how to write my name. It's—where do I sign?",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_012": "My eyelids, they're stuck... Doc, just step on my tail. It's fine, just stomp!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_013": "Just like when I wore my escort association's badge for the first time. Gotta keep my head bowed and tail tucked. I won't let you lose face, Doc!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_014": "There was this time I picked up a cloudbeast on a solo escort mission. We traveled together for a while. But just before entering the city, I set it free, afraid customers might see it and think I was soft. Now, I suppose I wouldn't be afraid to keep such a companion.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_017": "Three bulkies, twelve mid-sized… all set. Huh, why is there one more here? Did I count wrong?.",

        "char_445_wscoot_CN_019": "The fortune stick reads 'very lucky'! Only took one, two... five draws to get it. What a good sign! Let's go!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_020": "They've got guts, coming at us like this. Don't they recognize our banner? Guess we're in for a fight.",

        "char_445_wscoot_CN_022": "Just tell me where to go.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_023": "In position. Awaiting your command.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_024": "Give the signal and I'll do it.",

        "char_445_wscoot_CN_028": "I've already drawn my swords. You can beg for your life after we've fought.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_029": "We're friends for life from this day on, Doctor. One word from you and I'll rush to your aid, even if I'm on the other side of Terra—that's a promise.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_030": "The goods are intact, and everyone's unhurt! Ahhh, damn it!—I've dreamed of having such a reliable escort leader as you, Doctor.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_031": "Look at him run! He even lost his shoes, hahaha! As long as the goods are safe, that's all that matters. Bandits never forget an ass-kicking. Next time they hear our association's escort chant, they'll stay far away.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_032": "I'll keep them at bay while you go get backup. Want my goods? Over my dead body!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_033": "Oh, it's nothing, just a habit. Always make sure a room's safe before going in. Well, the facilities are secure, but the personnel are a bit... mixed. However, if you trust them, I'll consider it safe.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_034": "Come on, come on—argh! Almost caught that Burderupt! Oh, er, yes, this terminal is normally used for taking inventory, but there's always a way to install games. Keep it a secret, will you?",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_036": "Haha... you're allowed just this once. Ears are my weakness, after all.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_038": "Happy New Year, Doctor! Yeah, I'm preparing to set out. This is the peak season in my line of work. It's nothing. On the contrary, it's a good omen to get busy on the first day of the New Year. Hope we both have a prosperous year, Doctor!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_042": "Doctor. Yeah, I just finished training. I'll help out once I've cleaned up.",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_043": "Cut the crap, just stew it. The Doctor and I are friends for life, we'll have nothing but the finest birthday food! Stew the entire cystybeast! Hey, our usual bowls aren't fit for the Doctor. Find a smaller one, just enough for one catty of rice!",
        "char_445_wscoot_CN_044": "We developed several new routes last year to deliver goods for Rhodes Island. Those rascals were so busy they had no time to cause mischief, but they looked much more spirited and energetic. Better life to chase, more glow on face, as it's said. Hahaha... All that's to say, we look forward to your continued support for our business this year, Doctor.",

        "char_446_aroma_CN_003": "Sorry, Doctor. I didn't have the detergent-to-aroma formula under control. Um… I made some changes to it, and the aroma might linger in your nose for a very, very long time. You might smell it every now and then for the next two weeks...",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_004": "I put on a bubble show for the young patients at Medical today. What kind of show? It's like this... There’s a big, big, big bubble with a big, big bubble inside. And then the big, big bubble’s got a big bubble. And Bubble’s inside the big bubble. Oh, that last one is my partner, Bubble, not a normal bubble.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_005": "Doctor, my family's formulators aren't quite like the others in our industry. Our peers try to create aromas that remind users of a certain beautiful moment in their memories. But my family, we work to suppress the worst, most terrible smells in their memories.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_006": "All this time, I've thought that aromas by themselves couldn’t eradicate stenches. The most important thing is to open the windows and let the foul air out. Otherwise, the aroma and stench blend together, and that would just be a different, disgusting smell.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_007": "I'm cleaning the room right now, and you came at just the right time, Doctor. Would you help me wipe the light tubes up top? They're a bit too high, and I can't reach them, even on a ladder. Yeah, there's a small black spot just a little to the left... Ah! W-Why is that black spot flying?!",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_008": "Doctor, I brought some shampoo my family made onto the landship. It's from a small workshop, but we source all the essential oils we use from plants in nature. Like this lemon-scented one. We used lemons taken from my family's backyard, where my grandmother planted a lemon tree the year I was born.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_009": "There was a chaotic time where murders were a daily occurrence in Siracusa, and my family served as 'cleaners' charged with clearing out the aftermath. We left that line of work a long time ago, but every now and then, we still remember the thick stench of blood that seemed to overpower everything else.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_010": "Oh no. A bubble floated into the room and landed on the Doctor's nose... If somebody goes in there and thinks the Doctor's got a snot bubble, that wouldn't be good…",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_011": "Hello, Doctor. I'm Logistics Operator Aroma. Would you open your hands like this? Don't worry... I just thought that with how nice and bright the sun is today, it would be perfect to put a bubble reflecting a rainbow onto your palm.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_012": "This will make a very useful reference. I never knew detergent could be used like that.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_013": "Doctor, I will pass on your encouragement and feedback to my family. I'm pleased that you like our products so much.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_014": "Doctor, I'm humbled that my family's products are so well-liked by the operators here... Huh...? A manufacturing cooperation with Rhodes Island? Can we really?",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_017": "How convenient. I want to test out my new bubbling formula.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_018": "Remember to cover your noses. The aroma this time might be a little intense. Don't let the smell get you sneezing.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_019": "I put a sign here— Wet floor. Be extra careful.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_020": "The smell here reminds me of something really scary.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_021": "Detergent formula tuning complete!",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_022": "Bubbling equipment ready to go!",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_023": "These bubbles won't burst so easily.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_024": "Remember to give your honest feedback on our products.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_025": "Bubble richness, up to standard!",

        "char_446_aroma_CN_027": "Bubble expanding power, excellent!",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_028": "Stain removal efficiency, impeccable!",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_029": "Hm... smells a lot more refreshing now.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_030": "I like this new ingredient. It's effective, and it doesn't harm your skin.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_031": "Looks like we'll need a stronger stain removing formula next time.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_032": "What a stubborn stain...",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_033": "Doctor, n-no, I know it's polite to look at the person you're talking to... I-I'm not looking out the window. It's just... the water stains on the glass are making me really uncomfortable. I really want to wipe it.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_034": "Ah! Please don't do that. I almost splashed some of the soap I'm holding on you. ",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_036": "Watch out, Doctor! There's soapy water all over the floor. You could slip if you aren't careful.",

        "char_446_aroma_CN_038": "The New Year calls for new vibes, Doctor, so I put a small plant on your windowsill. I collected a bunch of lemon seeds from my family's kitchen and planted them. This is the one that grew the best.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_042": "You should go take a walk, Doctor. It's not good to stay in your office all day.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_043": "Perfume? Why would I give you perfume? Hehe, your scent shouldn't be covered by any other smell, Doctor. It’s natural and pleasing, much more so than any perfume I could mix.",
        "char_446_aroma_CN_044": "Every time a patient at Medical passes away, the clothing they wore gets sent to me to be washed and stored until their family comes to retrieve it one day. Some are picked up soon after, but others... still haven't been picked up even after a long, long time.",
        "char_449_glider_CN_001": "Do we work so hard every day? Hohh... this is rough... Doctor, if the stress ever gets to you, please don't bottle it up. I'll chat with you anytime.",
        "char_449_glider_CN_002": "Here, Doctor, this is for you. I sent an application to Dr. Kal'tsit, and remodeled an unused cabin into a conversation room. This is the leaflet I made myself!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_003": "I've heard there's a mysterious snackseller here who can dodge the Medical Department's controls, and shows up when anyone needs them... Doctor, is this all true?",
        "char_449_glider_CN_004": "As long as you take daily precautions, Oripathy is hardly that easy to catch! The sick aren't that dangerous, let alone their healthy relatives... Why do people always let ignorance scare them about this or that, and they're never even willing to look into it some more?",
        "char_449_glider_CN_005": "Doctor, look at this! Ehehe, it's a notice that I'm qualified and approved for psychological counseling. I've been preparing forever, and I finally passed the test!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_006": "My dad passed away when I was very little, because of Oripathy. The villagers were scared of getting infected, and they shunted us deep into the forest, far from the settlement. Life might've been very tough, but my mum still carried on as she took me through... Now I'm grown up, and it'll be my turn to look after her!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_007": "My old home was in the woodlands in west Rim Billiton. I grew up in the forest all my life, so I'm a bit familiar with all kinds of herbals. That said, herbals can treat your surface injuries, but invisible wounds on your spirit just aren't that easily cured...",
        "char_449_glider_CN_008": "Doctor, can I stay here? Would I be able to chat with you? I promise I won't interrupt your work! Everyone in the Medical Department has missions today, Mint's studying and she's not coming out for any fun, and there's no patients who need tending to. It's just me left now... I don't want to be alone...",
        "char_449_glider_CN_009": "I believe that getting good sleep, eating good food, and sharing the glad and the sad times with friends can make people happy. There's times when enduring too much does more harm... Doctor, just to let you know if you've got any worries, share them with me. Don't forget about it, okay?",
        "char_449_glider_CN_010": "Doctor, did you fall asleep...? Hmm, no reaction, gotta be asleep. Okay, good chance! Let's find where the Doctor's been hiding all those snacks...",
        "char_449_glider_CN_011": "Nice to meet you, I'm the new Medical Department intern, Honeyberry. I'm assuming you're the Doctor...? Hmm, it's just like Dr. Kal'tsit said. You're different enough from everyone else that I can tell you at a glance!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_012": "So you can do emergency treatment like this too...!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_013": "A promotion? So that means, I've cleared my internship without any problems?! That's brilliant!",
        "char_449_glider_CN_014": "I've learned and gained so much at Rhodes Island. It's all the experiences that build up, and all the beautiful memories, that give me the drive to keep going, to strive together with all of you!",

I've divided it into little pouches according to your intake each day, so eating one a day will supplement all the nutrients you need. Um, Doctor, Why are you hiding them?

Ta-dah—a robust little metal crabling, choice selection of the Beanstalk Breeding Company! Isn't he just adorable? Shh! You can't let anyone else know, or they'll all be hounding me for their own!",
        "char_452_bstalk_CN_044": "Rhodes Island dinner parties never fail to impress! But when do we get to hold a pet show here? We can compete to see whose pets know the most tricks, or just find out who's most popular. You want them to fight? Are you crazy, Doctor?! You think way too violent!",

        "char_455_nothin_CN_003": "D-Doctor, I was a little idle, and went to make myself useful at HR, and by carelessness glimpsed at a few operator files, and by chance… Er, by no means do I intend to pry into a fellow operator's privacy, Doctor, but could that FEater be the very star of 'Fiends of the Gods Reincarnated Immortal' herself? Truly? Could I go get an autograph?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_004": "Who was my master? Hmm, a question as complex as a showdown of Yanese cuisines. Normally I'd refrain from answering that, as slipping up would get me beaten sideways. That said... you need only know, Doctor, I'm the last descendant of the Lien line. Ah, but my family name's not Lien. It's Ch'u.",

Truth be told, my recollection's quite fuzzy now, yet I have the vague impression that within her painted dreams, I had a peek into my own miserable future... Ah, look at me, carried away by my emotions again. I say it's high time we set aside the nonsense and look forward. Now, You be careful too, Doctor.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_006": "Now, now, Doctor, don't worry about me. I and the Infected do get along well. Back at my old place, a Catastrophe once struck not too far away. It frightened all of us, seeing the world go pitch black. My master remarked then that Catastrophes were Heaven's false charge against the human realm. Ah, truly a bitter thing.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_007": "Benefactor Lava? Yes, I call her my benefactor. She once saved me, and as time went on, it became second nature. Throughout my life I've been saved thrice, and every time, I engrave it upon my soul. The gloompincer incident, you mean? No, not that. She showed to me a path, and that was true grace beyond all.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_008": "Say, Doctor, are people able to leave their past behind like water under the bridge? Certainly not, right? But if the bonds you once left behind still hold fast, what ought you do? You've no idea either? Well, then. It seems we're companions in our misery. Here, what say we crack some sunflower seeds?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_009": "Countless, they were, the ancient parasol trees about Kou-wu City. Oh, just reminiscing all of a sudden. I remember the leaves scattered across the ground come fall, when my parents would visit me from the country. Only then would my strict master speak nothing but good, and I would be spared of my seniors' bully for a moment. No, no, just reminiscing.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_010": "Hmm. I've been pondering a fan for you too, but what ought we write on it?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_011": "My codename? It's 'nothing' worth mentioning here. And you, fine soul, are the Doctor? That is to say, my new boss? Ah. Pleasure to meet you. How can I be of service? Perhaps you would like a back massage? Or some chiropractic maybe?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_012": "Ho. what a hundredfold bouquet of martial prowess. You've got my eyes wide open now!",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_013": "A promotion and a raise?! Ohh, ohh, I thank you, Doctor, in all respects possible! Be it for you, I would brave hell and high waters... That said, how much might my wages be growing by?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_014": "Sooner or later, I plan to return to Kou-wu City and set that last unsettled debt in my book straight. My only worry is I may invite trouble and sweep others up in its path. You know this, dear Doctor, and yet you still wish to bestow such partiality on me...? Your kindness toward me is a grace, and I will never, in eternity, forget it.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_017": "Very well! Doctor, I'll see to it that you have nothing at all to worry about.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_018": "Me, the captain? Hold one moment, just let me find my secret tomes for the art of war…",

        "char_455_nothin_CN_029": "More hands bring more fuel for the fire. When we concert our efforts together, yes, we truly can burn the sky a red to rival sunsets. Now that's what I call a feat!",

        "char_455_nothin_CN_038": "Come one, come all! Ah, hello, Doctor! Nice to see you here on such a holiday. The rest area's full of people, so I thought I'd issue some secret little tomes to life, at low prices to boot! Good tidings to all, won't you agree? Oh, speaking of which, Have you been sleeping well recently? I just so happen to have a copy of 'Winter Sleep-Aiding Breathing and Respiration Techniques'. What say you have a look?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_042": "Well, if it isn't the Doctor! What a happy coincidence!",

They signify this fresh year ahead of you will be a smooth sail, with waves and winds both on your side... You don't believe me? Not unless I give you a performance with this fan? I'd be put at a loss, you know, given my mere modest speck of kickboxing artistry. But you are the boss, your word is the law.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_044": "My master did tell me I was suited to martial arts, but she never taught of any place where you could use it, only that we shouldn't let down the conscience... Ah, I'm just thinking. If I'd not come to Rhodes Island, I'd probably be in Lungmen running a gym, I suppose? But all moneymaking aside, I fear I'd never have used this fan again.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_001": "Hm. The office of the vaunted Doctor, then? Marvelous, truly. Allow me a brief moment to consult my feng shui crash-course guidebook...",

Beyond a little kickboxing in a scuffle, I can rustle up meals, practice acupuncture, divine with feng shui, work masonry, tend to rice and angle fish alike—I'm a maestro of all kinds! Doctor, you need only give the order, and I'll see everything through!",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_003": "D-Doctor, I was a little idle, see, and went to make myself useful at HR, and by carelessness glimpsed at a few operator files, and... er, well, could FEater be the very star of 'Fiends of the Gods Reincarnated Immortal' herself? Truly? Could I go get an autograph?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_004": "Who was my master? Hmm, a question as complex as a showdown of Yan cuisines. Normally I'd refrain from answering that, as slipping up would get me beaten sideways. That said... you need only know, Doctor, I'm the last descendant of the Lien line. Ah, but my family name's not Lien. I'm a Ch'u.",

You be quite careful too, Doctor.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_006": "Now, now, Doctor, don't worry about me. I and the Infected do get along well. Back at my old place, a Catastrophe once struck not too far away. It frightened all of us, seeing the world go pitch black. My master remarked then that Catastrophes were Heaven's false charge against the human realm. Ah, truly a bitter thing.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_007": "Benefactor Lava? Yes, I call her my benefactor. She once saved me, and as time went on, it became second nature.

        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_008": "Say, Doctor, are people able to brush the past away as they live? Certainly not, hm? If the bonds you once left behind still hold fast, what ought you do? You've no idea either? Well, then. It seems we're companions in our misery. Here, what say we crack some sunflower seeds?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_009": "Countless, they were, the ancient parasol trees about Kou-wu City. Oh, just reminiscing all of a sudden. I remember the leaves scattered across the ground come fall, when my parents would visit me from the country. Only then would my strict master speak nothing but good, and her other disciples, my brothers and sisters, wouldn't bully me. No, well, just reminiscing.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_010": "Hmm. I've been pondering a fan for you too, but what ought we write on it?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_011": "My codename? 'Mr. Nothing.' The latter man of Tzu-hsu and Wu-yu; Nonexistent and Nothing indeed. And you, fine soul, are the Doctor? That is to say, my new boss? Well, then, would you like me to massage your back? Loosen up your legs?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_012": "Ho, what a hundredfold bouquet of martial prowess. You've got my eyes wide open now!",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_013": "A promotion and a raise?! Ohh, ohh, I thank you, Doctor, in all respects possible! Be it for you, I would brave the greatest fires and waters, I would not hesitate to... well, that said, how much might my wages be growing by?",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_014": "Sooner or later, I plan to return to Kou-wu City and set every debt in my books straight. My only worry is I may invite trouble and sweep others up in its path. You know this, dear Doctor, and yet you still wish to bestow such partiality on me...? Your kindness toward me is a grace, and I will never, in eternity, forget it.",
        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_017": "Very well! Doctor, I'll see to it that you have nothing at all to worry about.",

        "char_455_nothin_CN_TOPOLECT_CN_029": "More hands bring more fuel for the fire. When we concert our efforts together, yes, we truly can burn the sky a red to rival sunsets. Not bad, not bad.",

        "char_466_qanik_CN_014": "I won't make a fool of myself like before, Doctor! You've helped me so much. My mother's getting better, and my tribe is learning to use Rhodes Island medical equipment. I hope I can do even more for them in the future.",

That being said, how many Hunters can I still save other than Specter and Skadi? Even if I were to rescue another Hunter who survived by sheer luck, the fear may have crushed them whole long ago. Their future will be fraught with nothing but agony.",

You must never forget these things. They are proof that all humans once lived beneath the starry night sky. Through these arts, and upheld by us, humans become eternal. Come, let's dance.",
        "char_474_glady_CN_007": "Kal'tsit encouraged me to seek your help, though I still remain skeptical of its utility. The technology of land dwellers is primitive compared to that of Ægir, yet the average mental state is even more problematic. Fear and cowardice seem to pervade most of you. Honestly, I cannot imagine how you people would face 'that.'",

Uncomfortable as it is, this is still better than being surrounded by the dead bodies of my comrades... I remember how the sea was littered with shreds of corpses. Their deaths etched onto your brain, and the stench lingers on your tongue whenever you open your mouth. Yet you cannot hang your head.",
        "char_474_glady_CN_009": "Do you think we can form an alliance? We may not even be counted as the same species. Kal'tsit is far older than me. The burden she carries is beyond anyone's imagination, but it is also a burden you must face one day... You must get stronger, strong enough to fear no loss. I will watch you by your side.",

        "char_475_akafyu_CN_003": "That ninja... She may evade your eyes, but she cannot fool my senses. I know not what she schemes, but I can promise you I shall not engage her here and now. However, if I find her trying to harm my master... You won't be able to stop my blade.",

        "char_475_akafyu_CN_043": "Oh? Today's your birthday, Dr.{@nickname}? Haha! Come, I'll take you for ale and meat! Honestly, why stay quiet about a day so important? Hm? You wonder what I would've gotten you if I knew? Well, need you ask? Better ale and even more meat!",
        "char_475_akafyu_CN_044": "Never have I asked you what we fight for, yes? Stop, no need for an answer. Words are the least reliable of all. I only care that you've considered the question, and considered it well. Lead us forth on a just path, Doctor, and I assure you my katana will be sharp enough to cut through all.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_001": "Your files are all fully sorted. Hm? Was that fast? I wasn't dozing off on your last shift, after all. I have your whole workflow noted right inside my head.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_002": "Stop! You're triggering one of my traps. Move any further, and a bolt will blow your brains out. How could I fall asleep surrounded by traps? That's a strange question. I couldn't sleep at all without these little trinkets around me.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_003": "What we stole from the Leithanian nobles, they plundered from the land before that. We're the children of the wilds, but we are not unreasonable. Lungmen traders do good to others, and Siracusans keep to the rules, so I told my team not to lay a finger on them.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_004": "Is that Lee guy here too? He got me when I was careless, and now I want a rematch. No, no need to worry, none of the trinkets he carries interest me. You go tell him as much.",

        "char_476_blkngt_CN_006": "There's plenty who think the wilds are a frightening place, but to me, they were my home. I made a mistake once. It torn my family apart,  and these slumberfoots are the only ones left to roam with me. I'll never make a mistake like it again.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_007": "The name Blacknight was given to me by a Yan storyteller. I always used to do my work at night, pulling the floor from under them when those merchants were drowsy. Me and my slumberfoots would take away their wealth, and 'devour' their dreams too.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_008": "Don't act so nice to me... you never know when my crossbow will be aimed at your head. You don't believe I'm like that? Up to you, then. I've got no interest in dealing with a penniless good guy.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_009": "They called me their boss. So I protected them, gave them food and a place to rest. But now, for as long as I haven't beaten you, you're my boss. I'll protect you, and I'll follow your orders.",

        "char_476_blkngt_CN_013": "You're not worried I'll take the bonus and run? I'm joking. For that matter, a badge like this won't fetch any real money anyway.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_014": "Work and earn a living. I wonder if my parents lived a life like this in Rim Billiton? It's fine, but I'm not letting my crossbow rust.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_017": "Good timing. I need something to do.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_018": "You want me leading? Then you'll want to watch how I do it.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_019": "Listen up, darlings. Once we're on the battlefield, you need to listen to the Doctor too.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_020": "You want to run? Before you do, remember to leave your valuables behind.",

        "char_476_blkngt_CN_028": "Drill, open a hole!",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_029": "How'd me and the darlings do? No compliments for us?",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_030": "Not bad! I've learned some more moves.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_031": "I'll take a few to the next crossing. We need to get this cleaned up.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_032": "No, you have to get out of here! Do as I said, or the enemy will have you trapped. We'll retreat for now and think of a better way to fight back.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_033": "Roaming under the night sky is just one hundred times better than getting shut in here.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_034": "Who was that?!",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_036": "Tired? You can have Helmet to hug for a little bit, then. At least until tomorrow.",

        "char_476_blkngt_CN_038": "Well, New Year's today. Once winter passes, the caravans start coming again. If things were usual, we'd pull off a big job, and have a feast on the nobles' dime, celebrating all around. It's comfy times here, though, and I have no need for my old job. I wonder when I'll finally get the chance to bring those kids in.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_042": "Hey, Helmet, no running about in the corridor! Don't think I can't see you just because you're hiding in someone's arms... oh, fine, I'll let you off, for {@nickname}'s sake.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_043": "To the children of the wild, having food in your belly and a safe place to shelter's all the lucky blessings you'll ever count—no one has birthdays on their mind, and I have no idea what I should even give you. How about this? Ten favors I'll do you. Not missions from the Doctor of Rhodes Island, but things you want me to do.",
        "char_476_blkngt_CN_044": "I still remember some of my toddler days. The fireplace at home. Mum holding me. The little handicraft beastling from my dad. That was my first home. Then I left the wilds, and lost my home again. I know there's no protecting who I want to protect yet, not before I get stronger. So, you're not going to stop me in my step. No one will.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_001": "All done now. Um… do you mind if I read my manga here?",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_002": "A-ah. I'm just not cut out for real life relationships… On SNS, all I gotta do is send a request to make friends. Reality is such a nightmare.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_003": "Utage was my classmate in middle school, and the one who introduced me here. We're… friends, I guess, but Doctor, be warned, riajuus are terrifying!",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_004": "Eh? Why send messages when we're face to face? Uh, cuz, you know, it's easier that way…",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_005": "Back in Higashi, I saw Koga election vans on the street a bunch. Their representative is kinda hot... Um, but I don't understand much about that whole side of things, so usually I just voted whatever.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_006": "My family says that we all came out of the sea onto dry land forever ago, and that's how we settled down. Would I wanna go back into the sea? Mmnn... honestly, I don't really care.  As long as they don't get Oripathy, life's pretty good in Higashi.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_007": "There's some trouble lately. I hear things between us and the Kougon guys up north are getting heated again. This sucks... I wonder if their latest games will make it through…",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_008": "Um… Doctor, do you think my hobbies are weird or anything? When I was young, the other kids would make fun of me, calling me gross and gloomy. Hmph. Who cares what they said, I certainly don't.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_009": "Doctoooor! I'll lend you this game, this manga, and this CD! They're masterpieces that I handpicked, so once you go through them, we'll be otaku buddies for life! We will have so much to talk about. If you're into other genres, just say the word. Better yet, just come over and pick something you like.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_010": "Not now, pal, I'm busy right here! Just one more hit... one more hit and he's down! Perfect! Got the rare drop!",

        "char_478_kirara_CN_012": "Wow, that's cool… Uhhhh, the ultimate's name's kinda cringe though.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_013": "A promotion? As in a job promotion? Ugh, a middle management job is gonna kill me.",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_014": "I just want to thank everyone for, uh, sticking by me all this time. I realize that, uh some things are better… said in person than by text... So, um, I guess... Tha-that's all I want to say! Thank you!",
        "char_478_kirara_CN_017": "If you want a support, maybe I can help out… I guess.",

After all, you've obtained combat results beyond expectations, and made it marginally more difficult for my assessment of weapon performance limits to be universal and objective. I'll have to increase the quantity of test samples to ensure accuracy... was that in your plans too?",
        "char_489_serum_CN_030": "A pleasing result. It seems once we return and I finish collating this data, I'll have some spare time for free movement. Well, then, do you have any free time coming up, Doctor?",

        "char_497_ctable_CN_009": "Doctor, could you take me with you on your next field mission? I want to know the reasoning behind your every decision. Why did you save me, a stranger? Just what does my life mean to you...? I want to figure you out, just a little clearer.",

But, if I had a chance to get back to those barrens, a chance to weigh up what's behind those helping hands again, I would choose to starve to death there. Doctor, I've been thinking... how nice it would've been, if you were there offering your hand instead.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_017": "I trust your judgment. You won't lead me astray.",

        "char_497_ctable_CN_030": "Someday in the future, I'll have as clear a direction as you do.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_031": "We have a few runaways. A little like I once was.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_032": "This isn't happening, don't abandon me... Doctor, where are you?",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_033": "Are you interested in my instruments? I can teach you how to play.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_034": "Ah! Doctor... that's dangerous.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_036": "If I leave someday, you'll send me off, won't you?",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_038": "Such pretty fireworks... I used to think they were too far away, but here I am today, watching them lit below me. A single firework's just a tiny little thing, but there it goes, flying into the sky, blossoming into flowers so bright. Doctor, is that something I can aspire to?",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_042": "I heard the sound of your footsteps, Doctor.",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_043": "So today's your birthday... I don't even remember my own. Does my record in Medical note what day I was saved? I want that day to be my birthday. Doctor, I'll spend the day with you, so when my birthday comes, would you spend it with me?",
        "char_497_ctable_CN_044": "They told me I was meant to be an assassin, twisted my life onto a path it never should've taken. But they never even gave me a reason, and I did far too much I never should have done. You've given me a new lease on life, and I'll be sure to use it well.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_001": "You need my help with your mountain of work? Haha, I'm not sure if I should be <i>intervening</i> in Rhodes Island's internal affairs though...? It's no problem? Uh, really?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_002": "Our laws are incapable of perfectly solving every dispute. There are many situations where even the saints can't help. I must admit, I have a deep respect for people like the bishop from that monastery, considering the problems he faced. Too bad I don't have such lofty faith.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_003": "Was that Arene earlier? Now when did that punk learn some manners...? You taught him? Wow, now that's impressive! I guess even a devious boy like him is still just a boy. Easy enough to trick him onto the right track... Huh...? You didn't trick him?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_004": "Yo, Doctor! Ambriel and the others are doing a dessert potluck, and I'm bringing donuts. Mind helping me taste test? Okay, so what do you think—Whoa whoa, slow down on the water! It's too sweet and greasy? Strange, I thought the sugar level was just right...",
        "char_498_inside_CN_005": "Don't get me wrong, Doctor, yes, I was elected as 'a representative of the Notarial Hall', but that's just because everyone's curious about what magical place could  Federico endorse, and they needed someone out to take a look for them. In other words, they picked me to come take a look-see here. I've got no say on any matters relating to the Notarial Hall, so don't ask me about that sort of thing, okay?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_006": "I'm lucky I was born a Lateran. No, Doctor, our good fortune does not lie in our halos, but in our material abundance and strong state. You have an ideal Rhodes Island of your own? It's not easy, chasing your dreams, but... good luck I guess?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_007": "Take note of your posture, keep your crossbow aimed straight ahead, turn your body slightly... Yes, just like that, and then pull the trigger! Wow, bullseye! Very nice! Oh no, no need to thank me, I just helped correct your posture, that's all. You're very talented, Doctor.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_008": "Come sit over here, Doctor. I have something to discuss with you. There's a bunch of Sarkaz I know, and they're pretty good in a fight, so if Rhodes Island ever needs a few helping hands... Haha, yes, I'm not eager to make trouble for myself, but... Well, I might be going too soft, but why not consider it?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_009": "I thought you might have found this business annoying, so I dealt with it in your place, and here's the mission report. The scene was something of an eyesore, so I didn't attach any photos. I executed every last name in your notes, no exceptions.   What's with the look, Doctor? Do you feel unwell?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_010": "Oh, Doctor, you're awake… What? Please don't tell Dr. Kal'tsit and Amiya you were napping at work? Ahaha, what napping?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_011": "Liaison from the Lateran Notarial Hall, Insider. Here's the paperwork for our collaboration. May I ask which office I should be heading to next? I'm making my first impression here at Rhodes Island, so I want to do this perfectly.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_012": "Let's see... Ezell is still so merciful in battle, huh... Sheesh, Federico is the exact opposite!",
        "char_498_inside_CN_013": "Promotion? Thank you for your affirmation, Doctor. However, does this mean I'm going to have to handle even more difficult work in the future?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_014": "Many thanks. I will report that Rhodes Island intends to deepen the level of cooperation with the Notarial Hall... Wait, this is a personal commendation for me? Haha, what an honor.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_017": "Got it. You've determined that use of force is required in the current situation, and I'll trust you on that.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_018": "I'm in charge? Alright then, I would like everyone to act freely as they wish. And everyone is responsible for their own actions.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_019": "Firearm, check.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_020": "I wish everyone could just calm down, before I raise my gun to settle things.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_021": "Alright, mission accepted.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_022": "Bullets may be fast, but they aren't always so quick to solve disputes.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_023": "Chill, everyone, I'm just here for a few questions.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_024": "If you insist on being so stubborn, then... prepare for execution.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_025": "I'm actually better at wrestling than shooting. Makes the cleanup easier.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_026": "I'll give you some time to cry out in pain while I adjust my weapon.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_027": "I was really hoping it wouldn't turn out like this.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_028": "In our current situation... A complete sweep would be the most efficient solution.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_029": "I knew I was getting into trouble coming here, but thankfully I've got you, Doctor. I wouldn't have figured out how to resolve such a complicated conflict by myself.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_030": "Alright, time to pack up my gun. Mission complete, Doctor. We achieved victory just as planned, so there shouldn't be any post mortem work required, right?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_031": "What, did some of them escape? Ah, I had one eye closed while aiming my shots, so maybe they happened to be out of my sight.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_032": "It's clear we need to overhaul our plans.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_033": "You have such good accommodation here? This place is top-notch in all the foreign posting I've had.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_034": "Haha, Doctor. You're not scaring me that easily.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_036": "It's nice to occasionally get some rest in places like this corridor. After all, most of Laterano's benches are found only outdoors.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_037": "Arknights.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_038": "Happy New Year, Doctor! A new year usually comes with a multitude of troublesome incidents, and I don't know how Rhodes Island deals with... Why aren't I back in Laterano to work right now? Ahaha, foreign missions are also very important, you know.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_042": "You can take a break first, Doctor.",
        "char_498_inside_CN_043": "Doctor, what would you like for your birthday? One of the occasional tasks I get is to help people return unwanted gifts. Instead of making things so troublesome, it's better to just outright ask the recipient what they would like, don't you think?",
        "char_498_inside_CN_044": "Hmm, the atmosphere calls for a serious talk, does it? Alright, I'll be serious, Doctor, I wasn't actually that curious about Rhodes Island compared to the other executors, but now, I really admire your capabilities. Moving towards conflict instead of avoiding it is definitely not easy.",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_001": "I won't refuse if you insist, but my poor vision makes it difficult for me to handle clerical work.",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_002": "The Engineering Department is very interested in my weapon. I wish I could explain how it works, but all I know is that it requires high-purity gem crystals to run. I have ways to acquire gem scraps, but cutting a precious stone of great value into pieces works the same.",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_003": "My gosh, briefing documents again? You're not lacking in manpower or technology. My advice would be to avoid spending time and effort on roundabout things... Oh, you didn't bring documents. Then I must express my gratitude. I don't want to be gazing at graphs or designs anymore. It hurts my eyes.",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_004": "Whistle? Oh, it was me whistling a Leithanian tune. My sincerest apologies, this place just makes me feel relaxed, and it wasn't my... You seem to be fine with it? Strange... to my knowledge, every spire-dweller feels insulted when they hear the sound, and even the mildest scholar would lose his temper when a child whistles at them on the streets.",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_005": "I've lived with the Infected since I was little, so it was only natural that I would get Oripathy myself... Well, Rhodes Island doesn't seem to accept that explanation. Then how do you like the story of a single explosion at the quarry that also collapsed many futures? A story too fanciful to believe, don't you think?",
        "char_499_kaitou_CN_006": "I may have underestimated you, Doctor. Tell me, would you like to bet on me? Betting on whether I'm worth trusting, betting on what tricks I have up my sleeves, betting on if I'm more than an infected. Of course, should you have a change of mind, I'll get back and continue to work on my worthless stone.",

        "char_512_aprot_CN_004": "It is quite the relief you were with us last mission, Doctor. I find myself dazed by the sight of you when you command. As if something crosses past the curtain of night and the stirring stars, leading your way...",

        "char_512_aprot_CN_007": "You wish to learn of the Crimson Troupe's affairs? Of course, I know of them all. But take caution, Doctor, for should you stray like they from the proper path... or come near to too many of them, you may be taken hold of. And that is not, whatsoever, desirable.",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_008": "Here you are once more. Please, sit. Be reassured that I will not drive you out. So, what's the matter this time? Could Hibiscus have made another healthy meal? Or is Sideroca bound to whisk you away for training again?",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_009": "My stories are hackneyed, bereft of novelty. Likely, not as engaging as you imagine. You would like to hear them nonetheless? Very well. Then I will tell you tales... but in exchange, Doctor, would you grant me a request?",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_010": "Doctor. Doctor? Beg pardon, I know I should not disturb your rest... but it is far too still here for me to fully be at ease.",

        "char_512_aprot_CN_034": "Ah... I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_036": "Doctor, could you hold my coat for me briefly? I'll be done in a moment. My thanks.",

A grand performance is about to begin, Doctor, and when the time has come, will you be able to recognize the true me beneath the limelight?",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_042": "Welcome, Doctor. Indeed, I knew you would surely come.",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_043": "Excellent, you are here just as I expected. Though some young operators express their affection in far too ardent ways, you'll nevertheless break their hearts should you hide away like this. And one more hint before you open the door, try to place your feet back, and find something to brace against. Yes. This way, you won't be thrown to the floor when they joyfully tackle you.",
        "char_512_aprot_CN_044": "I have to wear this...? Are you sure, Doctor? I don't recall this sort of adornment being called for on the stage... Very well... And dance with you? That would be a little... Oh my. Excuse me, Doctor. The steps here should go like this... Here, let me show you.",
        "char_513_apionr_CN_017": "Give your orders. I will work with them the best I can.",
        "char_513_apionr_CN_018": "I have nothing to say. But remember this one word: survive.",
